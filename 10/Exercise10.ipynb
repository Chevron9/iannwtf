You must in no way say he is covetous.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nIf I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;\\nhe hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.\\nWhat shouts are these? The other side o' the city\\nis risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!\\n\\nAll:\\nCome, come.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nSoft! who comes here?\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nWorthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved\\nthe people.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nHe's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you\\nWith bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nOur business is not unknown to the senate; they have\\nhad inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,\\nwhich now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor\\nsuitors have strong breaths: they shall know we\\nhave strong arms too.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhy, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,\\nWill you undo yourselves?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nWe cannot, sir, we are undone already.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI tell you, friends, most charitable care\\nHave the patricians of you. For your wants,\\nYour suffering in this dearth, you may as well\\nStrike at the heaven with your staves as lift them\\nAgainst the Roman state, whose course will on\\nThe way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs\\nOf more strong link asunder than can ever\\nAppear in your impediment. For the dearth,\\nThe gods, not the patricians, make it, and\\nYour knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,\\nYou are transported by calamity\\nThither where more attends you, and you slander\\nThe helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,\\nWhen you curse them as enemies.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nCare for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us\\nyet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses\\ncrammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to\\nsupport usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act\\nestablished against the rich, and provide more\\npiercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain\\nthe poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and\\nthere's all the love they bear us.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nEither you must\\nConfess yourselves wondrous malicious,\\nOr be accused of folly. I shall tell you\\nA pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;\\nBut, since it serves my purpose, I will venture\\nTo stale 't a little more.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nWell, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to\\nfob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please\\nyou, deliver.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThere was a time when all the body's members\\nRebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:\\nThat only like a gulf it did remain\\nI' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,\\nStill cupboarding the viand, never bearing\\nLike labour with the rest, where the other instruments\\nDid see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,\\nAnd, mutually participate, did minister\\nUnto the appetite and affection common\\nOf the whole body. The belly answer'd--\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nWell, sir, what answer made the belly?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,\\nWhich ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--\\nFor, look you, I may make the belly smile\\nAs well as speak--it tauntingly replied\\nTo the discontented members, the mutinous parts\\nThat envied his receipt; even so most fitly\\nAs you malign our senators for that\\nThey are not such as you.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nYour belly's answer? What!\\nThe kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,\\nThe counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,\\nOur steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.\\nWith other muniments and petty helps\\nIn this our fabric, if that they--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat then?\\n'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nShould by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,\\nWho is the sink o' the body,--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWell, what then?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nThe former agents, if they did complain,\\nWhat could the belly answer?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI will tell you\\nIf you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--\\nPatience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nYe're long about it.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNote me this, good friend;\\nYour most grave belly was deliberate,\\nNot rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:\\n'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,\\n'That I receive the general food at first,\\nWhich you do live upon; and fit it is,\\nBecause I am the store-house and the shop\\nOf the whole body: but, if you do remember,\\nI send it through the rivers of your blood,\\nEven to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;\\nAnd, through the cranks and offices of man,\\nThe strongest nerves and small inferior veins\\nFrom me receive that natural competency\\nWhereby they live: and though that all at once,\\nYou, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nAy, sir; well, well.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\n'Though all at once cannot\\nSee what I do deliver out to each,\\nYet I can make my audit up, that all\\nFrom me do back receive the flour of all,\\nAnd leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nIt was an answer: how apply you this?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe senators of Rome are this good belly,\\nAnd you the mutinous members; for examine\\nTheir counsels and their cares, digest things rightly\\nTouching the weal o' the common, you shall find\\nNo public benefit which you receive\\nBut it proceeds or comes from them to you\\nAnd no way from yourselves. What do you think,\\nYou, the great toe of this assembly?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nI the great toe! why the great toe?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFor that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,\\nOf this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:\\nThou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,\\nLead'st first to win some vantage.\\nBut make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:\\nRome and her rats are at the point of battle;\\nThe one side must have bale.\\nHail, noble Marcius!\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,\\nThat, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,\\nMake yourselves scabs?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nWe have ever your good word.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nHe that will give good words to thee will flatter\\nBeneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,\\nThat like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,\\nThe other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,\\nWhere he should find you lions, finds you hares;\\nWhere foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,\\nThan is the coal of fire upon the ice,\\nOr hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is\\nTo make him worthy whose offence subdues him\\nAnd curse that justice did it.\\nWho deserves greatness\\nDeserves your hate; and your affections are\\nA sick man's appetite, who desires most that\\nWhich would increase his evil. He that depends\\nUpon your favours swims with fins of lead\\nAnd hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?\\nWith every minute you do change a mind,\\nAnd call him noble that was now your hate,\\nHim vile that was your garland. What's the matter,\\nThat in these several places of the city\\nYou cry against the noble senate, who,\\nUnder the gods, keep you in awe, which else\\nWould feed on one another? What's their seeking?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFor corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,\\nThe city is well stored.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nHang 'em! They say!\\nThey'll sit by the fire, and presume to know\\nWhat's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,\\nWho thrives and who declines; side factions\\nand give out\\nConjectural marriages; making parties strong\\nAnd feebling such as stand not in their liking\\nBelow their cobbled shoes. They say there's\\ngrain enough!\\nWould the nobility lay aside their ruth,\\nAnd let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry\\nWith thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high\\nAs I could pick my lance.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;\\nFor though abundantly they lack discretion,\\nYet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,\\nWhat says the other troop?\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThey are dissolved: hang 'em!\\nThey said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,\\nThat hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,\\nThat meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not\\nCorn for the rich men only: with these shreds\\nThey vented their complainings; which being answer'd,\\nAnd a petition granted them, a strange one--\\nTo break the heart of generosity,\\nAnd make bold power look pale--they threw their caps\\nAs they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,\\nShouting their emulation.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat is granted them?\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nFive tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,\\nOf their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,\\nSicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!\\nThe rabble should have first unroof'd the city,\\nEre so prevail'd with me: it will in time\\nWin upon power and throw forth greater themes\\nFor insurrection's arguing.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThis is strange.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nGo, get you home, you fragments!\\n\\nMessenger:\\nWhere's Caius Marcius?\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nHere: what's the matter?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nThe news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent\\nOur musty superfluity. See, our best elders.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nMarcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;\\nThe Volsces are in arms.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThey have a leader,\\nTullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.\\nI sin in envying his nobility,\\nAnd were I any thing but what I am,\\nI would wish me only he.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYou have fought together.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nWere half to half the world by the ears and he.\\nUpon my party, I'ld revolt to make\\nOnly my wars with him: he is a lion\\nThat I am proud to hunt.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nThen, worthy Marcius,\\nAttend upon Cominius to these wars.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nIt is your former promise.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nSir, it is;\\nAnd I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou\\nShalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.\\nWhat, art thou stiff? stand'st out?\\n\\nTITUS:\\nNo, Caius Marcius;\\nI'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,\\nEre stay behind this business.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nO, true-bred!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nYour company to the Capitol; where, I know,\\nOur greatest friends attend us.\\n\\nTITUS:\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nNoble Marcius!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nNay, let them follow:\\nThe Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither\\nTo gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,\\nYour valour puts well forth: pray, follow.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWas ever man so proud as is this Marcius?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHe has no equal.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhen we were chosen tribunes for the people,--\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nMark'd you his lip and eyes?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNay. but his taunts.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nBeing moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nBe-mock the modest moon.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThe present wars devour him: he is grown\\nToo proud to be so valiant.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nSuch a nature,\\nTickled with good success, disdains the shadow\\nWhich he treads on at noon: but I do wonder\\nHis insolence can brook to be commanded\\nUnder Cominius.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nFame, at the which he aims,\\nIn whom already he's well graced, can not\\nBetter be held nor more attain'd than by\\nA place below the first: for what miscarries\\nShall be the general's fault, though he perform\\nTo the utmost of a man, and giddy censure\\nWill then cry out of Marcius 'O if he\\nHad borne the business!'\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nBesides, if things go well,\\nOpinion that so sticks on Marcius shall\\nOf his demerits rob Cominius.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCome:\\nHalf all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.\\nThough Marcius earned them not, and all his faults\\nTo Marcius shall be honours, though indeed\\nIn aught he merit not.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nLet's hence, and hear\\nHow the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,\\nMore than his singularity, he goes\\nUpon this present action.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLets along.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nSo, your opinion is, Aufidius,\\nThat they of Rome are entered in our counsels\\nAnd know how we proceed.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nIs it not yours?\\nWhat ever have been thought on in this state,\\nThat could be brought to bodily act ere Rome\\nHad circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone\\nSince I heard thence; these are the words: I think\\nI have the letter here; yes, here it is.\\n'They have press'd a power, but it is not known\\nWhether for east or west: the dearth is great;\\nThe people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,\\nCominius, Marcius your old enemy,\\nWho is of Rome worse hated than of you,\\nAnd Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,\\nThese three lead on this preparation\\nWhither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:\\nConsider of it.'\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nOur army's in the field\\nWe never yet made doubt but Rome was ready\\nTo answer us.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nNor did you think it folly\\nTo keep your great pretences veil'd till when\\nThey needs must show themselves; which\\nin the hatching,\\nIt seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.\\nWe shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was\\nTo take in many towns ere almost Rome\\nShould know we were afoot.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nNoble Aufidius,\\nTake your commission; hie you to your bands:\\nLet us alone to guard Corioli:\\nIf they set down before 's, for the remove\\nBring your army; but, I think, you'll find\\nThey've not prepared for us.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nO, doubt not that;\\nI speak from certainties. Nay, more,\\nSome parcels of their power are forth already,\\nAnd only hitherward. I leave your honours.\\nIf we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,\\n'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike\\nTill one can do no more.\\n\\nAll:\\nThe gods assist you!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nAnd keep your honours safe!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nFarewell.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nFarewell.\\n\\nAll:\\nFarewell.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a\\nmore comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I\\nshould freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he\\nwon honour than in the embracements of his bed where\\nhe would show most love. When yet he was but\\ntender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when\\nyouth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when\\nfor a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not\\nsell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering\\nhow honour would become such a person. that it was\\nno better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if\\nrenown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek\\ndanger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel\\nwar I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows\\nbound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not\\nmore in joy at first hearing he was a man-child\\nthan now in first seeing he had proved himself a\\nman.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nBut had he died in the business, madam; how then?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nThen his good report should have been my son; I\\ntherein would have found issue. Hear me profess\\nsincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love\\nalike and none less dear than thine and my good\\nMarcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their\\ncountry than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.\\n\\nGentlewoman:\\nMadam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nBeseech you, give me leave to retire myself.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nIndeed, you shall not.\\nMethinks I hear hither your husband's drum,\\nSee him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,\\nAs children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:\\nMethinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:\\n'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,\\nThough you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow\\nWith his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,\\nLike to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow\\nOr all or lose his hire.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nHis bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nAway, you fool! it more becomes a man\\nThan gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,\\nWhen she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier\\nThan Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood\\nAt Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,\\nWe are fit to bid her welcome.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nHeavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nHe'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee\\nAnd tread upon his neck.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nMy ladies both, good day to you.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nSweet madam.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nI am glad to see your ladyship.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nHow do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.\\nWhat are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good\\nfaith. How does your little son?\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nI thank your ladyship; well, good madam.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nHe had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than\\nlook upon his school-master.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nO' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a\\nvery pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'\\nWednesday half an hour together: has such a\\nconfirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded\\nbutterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go\\nagain; and after it again; and over and over he\\ncomes, and again; catched it again; or whether his\\nfall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his\\nteeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked\\nit!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nOne on 's father's moods.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nIndeed, la, 'tis a noble child.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nA crack, madam.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nCome, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play\\nthe idle husewife with me this afternoon.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nNo, good madam; I will not out of doors.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nNot out of doors!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nShe shall, she shall.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nIndeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the\\nthreshold till my lord return from the wars.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nFie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,\\nyou must go visit the good lady that lies in.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nI will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with\\nmy prayers; but I cannot go thither.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nWhy, I pray you?\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\n'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nYou would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all\\nthe yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill\\nIthaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric\\nwere sensible as your finger, that you might leave\\npricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nNo, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nIn truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you\\nexcellent news of your husband.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nO, good madam, there can be none yet.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nVerily, I do not jest with you; there came news from\\nhim last night.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nIndeed, madam?\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nIn earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.\\nThus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against\\nwhom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of\\nour Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set\\ndown before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt\\nprevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,\\non mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nGive me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every\\nthing hereafter.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nLet her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but\\ndisease our better mirth.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nIn troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.\\nCome, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy\\nsolemness out o' door. and go along with us.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nNo, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish\\nyou much mirth.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nWell, then, farewell.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nYonder comes news. A wager they have met.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nMy horse to yours, no.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\n'Tis done.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nAgreed.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nSay, has our general met the enemy?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nThey lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nSo, the good horse is mine.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI'll buy him of you.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nNo, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will\\nFor half a hundred years. Summon the town.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nHow far off lie these armies?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nWithin this mile and half.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThen shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.\\nNow, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,\\nThat we with smoking swords may march from hence,\\nTo help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.\\nTutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nNo, nor a man that fears you less than he,\\nThat's lesser than a little.\\nHark! our drums\\nAre bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,\\nRather than they shall pound us up: our gates,\\nWhich yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;\\nThey'll open of themselves.\\nHark you. far off!\\nThere is Aufidius; list, what work he makes\\nAmongst your cloven army.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nO, they are at it!\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nTheir noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThey fear us not, but issue forth their city.\\nNow put your shields before your hearts, and fight\\nWith hearts more proof than shields. Advance,\\nbrave Titus:\\nThey do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,\\nWhich makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:\\nHe that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,\\nAnd he shall feel mine edge.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nAll the contagion of the south light on you,\\nYou shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues\\nPlaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd\\nFurther than seen and one infect another\\nAgainst the wind a mile! You souls of geese,\\nThat bear the shapes of men, how have you run\\nFrom slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!\\nAll hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale\\nWith flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,\\nOr, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe\\nAnd make my wars on you: look to't: come on;\\nIf you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,\\nAs they us to our trenches followed.\\nSo, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:\\n'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,\\nNot for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nFool-hardiness; not I.\\n\\nSecond Soldier:\\nNor I.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nSee, they have shut him in.\\n\\nAll:\\nTo the pot, I warrant him.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nWhat is become of Marcius?\\n\\nAll:\\nSlain, sir, doubtless.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nFollowing the fliers at the very heels,\\nWith them he enters; who, upon the sudden,\\nClapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,\\nTo answer all the city.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nO noble fellow!\\nWho sensibly outdares his senseless sword,\\nAnd, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:\\nA carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,\\nWere not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier\\nEven to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible\\nOnly in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and\\nThe thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,\\nThou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world\\nWere feverous and did tremble.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nLook, sir.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nO,'tis Marcius!\\nLet's fetch him off, or make remain alike.\\n\\nFirst Roman:\\nThis will I carry to Rome.\\n\\nSecond Roman:\\nAnd I this.\\n\\nThird Roman:\\nA murrain on't! I took this for silver.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nSee here these movers that do prize their hours\\nAt a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,\\nIrons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would\\nBury with those that wore them, these base slaves,\\nEre yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!\\nAnd hark, what noise the general makes! To him!\\nThere is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,\\nPiercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take\\nConvenient numbers to make good the city;\\nWhilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste\\nTo help Cominius.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nWorthy sir, thou bleed'st;\\nThy exercise hath been too violent for\\nA second course of fight.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nSir, praise me not;\\nMy work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:\\nThe blood I drop is rather physical\\nThan dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus\\nI will appear, and fight.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nNow the fair goddess, Fortune,\\nFall deep in love with thee; and her great charms\\nMisguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,\\nProsperity be thy page!\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThy friend no less\\nThan those she placeth highest! So, farewell.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nThou worthiest Marcius!\\nGo, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;\\nCall thither all the officers o' the town,\\nWhere they shall know our mind: away!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nBreathe you, my friends: well fought;\\nwe are come off\\nLike Romans, neither foolish in our stands,\\nNor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,\\nWe shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,\\nBy interims and conveying gusts we have heard\\nThe charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!\\nLead their successes as we wish our own,\\nThat both our powers, with smiling\\nfronts encountering,\\nMay give you thankful sacrifice.\\nThy news?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nThe citizens of Corioli have issued,\\nAnd given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:\\nI saw our party to their trenches driven,\\nAnd then I came away.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThough thou speak'st truth,\\nMethinks thou speak'st not well.\\nHow long is't since?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nAbove an hour, my lord.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\n'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:\\nHow couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,\\nAnd bring thy news so late?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nSpies of the Volsces\\nHeld me in chase, that I was forced to wheel\\nThree or four miles about, else had I, sir,\\nHalf an hour since brought my report.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nWho's yonder,\\nThat does appear as he were flay'd? O gods\\nHe has the stamp of Marcius; and I have\\nBefore-time seen him thus.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThe shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour\\nMore than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue\\nFrom every meaner man.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nCome I too late?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nAy, if you come not in the blood of others,\\nBut mantled in your own.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nO, let me clip ye\\nIn arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart\\nAs merry as when our nuptial day was done,\\nAnd tapers burn'd to bedward!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nFlower of warriors,\\nHow is it with Titus Lartius?\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nAs with a man busied about decrees:\\nCondemning some to death, and some to exile;\\nRansoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;\\nHolding Corioli in the name of Rome,\\nEven like a fawning greyhound in the leash,\\nTo let him slip at will.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nWhere is that slave\\nWhich told me they had beat you to your trenches?\\nWhere is he? call him hither.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nLet him alone;\\nHe did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,\\nThe common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--\\nThe mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge\\nFrom rascals worse than they.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nBut how prevail'd you?\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nWill the time serve to tell? I do not think.\\nWhere is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?\\nIf not, why cease you till you are so?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nMarcius,\\nWe have at disadvantage fought and did\\nRetire to win our purpose.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nHow lies their battle? know you on which side\\nThey have placed their men of trust?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nAs I guess, Marcius,\\nTheir bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,\\nOf their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,\\nTheir very heart of hope.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI do beseech you,\\nBy all the battles wherein we have fought,\\nBy the blood we have shed together, by the vows\\nWe have made to endure friends, that you directly\\nSet me against Aufidius and his Antiates;\\nAnd that you not delay the present, but,\\nFilling the air with swords advanced and darts,\\nWe prove this very hour.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThough I could wish\\nYou were conducted to a gentle bath\\nAnd balms applied to, you, yet dare I never\\nDeny your asking: take your choice of those\\nThat best can aid your action.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThose are they\\nThat most are willing. If any such be here--\\nAs it were sin to doubt--that love this painting\\nWherein you see me smear'd; if any fear\\nLesser his person than an ill report;\\nIf any think brave death outweighs bad life\\nAnd that his country's dearer than himself;\\nLet him alone, or so many so minded,\\nWave thus, to express his disposition,\\nAnd follow Marcius.\\nO, me alone! make you a sword of me?\\nIf these shows be not outward, which of you\\nBut is four Volsces? none of you but is\\nAble to bear against the great Aufidius\\nA shield as hard as his. A certain number,\\nThough thanks to all, must I select\\nfrom all: the rest\\nShall bear the business in some other fight,\\nAs cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;\\nAnd four shall quickly draw out my command,\\nWhich men are best inclined.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nMarch on, my fellows:\\nMake good this ostentation, and you shall\\nDivide in all with us.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nSo, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,\\nAs I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch\\nThose centuries to our aid: the rest will serve\\nFor a short holding: if we lose the field,\\nWe cannot keep the town.\\n\\nLieutenant:\\nFear not our care, sir.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nHence, and shut your gates upon's.\\nOur guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee\\nWorse than a promise-breaker.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWe hate alike:\\nNot Afric owns a serpent I abhor\\nMore than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nLet the first budger die the other's slave,\\nAnd the gods doom him after!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nIf I fly, Marcius,\\nHolloa me like a hare.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nWithin these three hours, Tullus,\\nAlone I fought in your Corioli walls,\\nAnd made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood\\nWherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge\\nWrench up thy power to the highest.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWert thou the Hector\\nThat was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,\\nThou shouldst not scape me here.\\nOfficious, and not valiant, you have shamed me\\nIn your condemned seconds.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nIf I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,\\nThou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it\\nWhere senators shall mingle tears with smiles,\\nWhere great patricians shall attend and shrug,\\nI' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,\\nAnd, gladly quaked, hear more; where the\\ndull tribunes,\\nThat, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,\\nShall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods\\nOur Rome hath such a soldier.'\\nYet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,\\nHaving fully dined before.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nO general,\\nHere is the steed, we the caparison:\\nHadst thou beheld--\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nPray now, no more: my mother,\\nWho has a charter to extol her blood,\\nWhen she does praise me grieves me. I have done\\nAs you have done; that's what I can; induced\\nAs you have been; that's for my country:\\nHe that has but effected his good will\\nHath overta'en mine act.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYou shall not be\\nThe grave of your deserving; Rome must know\\nThe value of her own: 'twere a concealment\\nWorse than a theft, no less than a traducement,\\nTo hide your doings; and to silence that,\\nWhich, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,\\nWould seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you\\nIn sign of what you are, not to reward\\nWhat you have done--before our army hear me.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI have some wounds upon me, and they smart\\nTo hear themselves remember'd.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nShould they not,\\nWell might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,\\nAnd tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,\\nWhereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all\\nThe treasure in this field achieved and city,\\nWe render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,\\nBefore the common distribution, at\\nYour only choice.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI thank you, general;\\nBut cannot make my heart consent to take\\nA bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;\\nAnd stand upon my common part with those\\nThat have beheld the doing.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nMay these same instruments, which you profane,\\nNever sound more! when drums and trumpets shall\\nI' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be\\nMade all of false-faced soothing!\\nWhen steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,\\nLet him be made a coverture for the wars!\\nNo more, I say! For that I have not wash'd\\nMy nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--\\nWhich, without note, here's many else have done,--\\nYou shout me forth\\nIn acclamations hyperbolical;\\nAs if I loved my little should be dieted\\nIn praises sauced with lies.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nToo modest are you;\\nMore cruel to your good report than grateful\\nTo us that give you truly: by your patience,\\nIf 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,\\nLike one that means his proper harm, in manacles,\\nThen reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,\\nAs to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius\\nWears this war's garland: in token of the which,\\nMy noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,\\nWith all his trim belonging; and from this time,\\nFor what he did before Corioli, call him,\\nWith all the applause and clamour of the host,\\nCAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear\\nThe addition nobly ever!\\n\\nAll:\\nCaius Marcius Coriolanus!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI will go wash;\\nAnd when my face is fair, you shall perceive\\nWhether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.\\nI mean to stride your steed, and at all times\\nTo undercrest your good addition\\nTo the fairness of my power.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nSo, to our tent;\\nWhere, ere we do repose us, we will write\\nTo Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,\\nMust to Corioli back: send us to Rome\\nThe best, with whom we may articulate,\\nFor their own good and ours.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nI shall, my lord.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThe gods begin to mock me. I, that now\\nRefused most princely gifts, am bound to beg\\nOf my lord general.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nTake't; 'tis yours. What is't?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI sometime lay here in Corioli\\nAt a poor man's house; he used me kindly:\\nHe cried to me; I saw him prisoner;\\nBut then Aufidius was within my view,\\nAnd wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you\\nTo give my poor host freedom.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nO, well begg'd!\\nWere he the butcher of my son, he should\\nBe free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nMarcius, his name?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nBy Jupiter! forgot.\\nI am weary; yea, my memory is tired.\\nHave we no wine here?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nGo we to our tent:\\nThe blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time\\nIt should be look'd to: come.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nThe town is ta'en!\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\n'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nCondition!\\nI would I were a Roman; for I cannot,\\nBeing a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!\\nWhat good condition can a treaty find\\nI' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,\\nI have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,\\nAnd wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter\\nAs often as we eat. By the elements,\\nIf e'er again I meet him beard to beard,\\nHe's mine, or I am his: mine emulation\\nHath not that honour in't it had; for where\\nI thought to crush him in an equal force,\\nTrue sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way\\nOr wrath or craft may get him.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nHe's the devil.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nBolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd\\nWith only suffering stain by him; for him\\nShall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,\\nBeing naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,\\nThe prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,\\nEmbarquements all of fury, shall lift up\\nTheir rotten privilege and custom 'gainst\\nMy hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it\\nAt home, upon my brother's guard, even there,\\nAgainst the hospitable canon, would I\\nWash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;\\nLearn how 'tis held; and what they are that must\\nBe hostages for Rome.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nWill not you go?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--\\n'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither\\nHow the world goes, that to the pace of it\\nI may spur on my journey.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nI shall, sir.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGood or bad?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNot according to the prayer of the people, for they\\nlove not Marcius.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNature teaches beasts to know their friends.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPray you, who does the wolf love?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThe lamb.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAy, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the\\nnoble Marcius.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHe's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHe's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two\\nare old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.\\n\\nBoth:\\nWell, sir.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nIn what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two\\nhave not in abundance?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHe's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nEspecially in pride.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nAnd topping all others in boasting.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThis is strange now: do you two know how you are\\ncensured here in the city, I mean of us o' the\\nright-hand file? do you?\\n\\nBoth:\\nWhy, how are we censured?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nBecause you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?\\n\\nBoth:\\nWell, well, sir, well.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhy, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of\\noccasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:\\ngive your dispositions the reins, and be angry at\\nyour pleasures; at the least if you take it as a\\npleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for\\nbeing proud?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWe do it not alone, sir.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI know you can do very little alone; for your helps\\nare many, or else your actions would grow wondrous\\nsingle: your abilities are too infant-like for\\ndoing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you\\ncould turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,\\nand make but an interior survey of your good selves!\\nO that you could!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWhat then, sir?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhy, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,\\nproud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as\\nany in Rome.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nMenenius, you are known well enough too.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that\\nloves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying\\nTiber in't; said to be something imperfect in\\nfavouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like\\nupon too trivial motion; one that converses more\\nwith the buttock of the night than with the forehead\\nof the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my\\nmalice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as\\nyou are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink\\nyou give me touch my palate adversely, I make a\\ncrooked face at it. I can't say your worships have\\ndelivered the matter well, when I find the ass in\\ncompound with the major part of your syllables: and\\nthough I must be content to bear with those that say\\nyou are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that\\ntell you you have good faces. If you see this in\\nthe map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known\\nwell enough too? what barm can your bisson\\nconspectuities glean out of this character, if I be\\nknown well enough too?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCome, sir, come, we know you well enough.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You\\nare ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you\\nwear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a\\ncause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;\\nand then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a\\nsecond day of audience. When you are hearing a\\nmatter between party and party, if you chance to be\\npinched with the colic, you make faces like\\nmummers; set up the bloody flag against all\\npatience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,\\ndismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled\\nby your hearing: all the peace you make in their\\ncause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are\\na pair of strange ones.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCome, come, you are well understood to be a\\nperfecter giber for the table than a necessary\\nbencher in the Capitol.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nOur very priests must become mockers, if they shall\\nencounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When\\nyou speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the\\nwagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not\\nso honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's\\ncushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-\\nsaddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;\\nwho in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors\\nsince Deucalion, though peradventure some of the\\nbest of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to\\nyour worships: more of your conversation would\\ninfect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly\\nplebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.\\nHow now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,\\nwere she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow\\nyour eyes so fast?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nHonourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for\\nthe love of Juno, let's go.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHa! Marcius coming home!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nAy, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous\\napprobation.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nTake my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!\\nMarcius coming home!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nNay,'tis true.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nLook, here's a letter from him: the state hath\\nanother, his wife another; and, I think, there's one\\nat home for you.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for\\nme!\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nYes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nA letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven\\nyears' health; in which time I will make a lip at\\nthe physician: the most sovereign prescription in\\nGalen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,\\nof no better report than a horse-drench. Is he\\nnot wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nO, no, no, no.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nO, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSo do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'\\nvictory in his pocket? the wounds become him.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nOn's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home\\nwith the oaken garland.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHas he disciplined Aufidius soundly?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nTitus Lartius writes, they fought together, but\\nAufidius got off.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAnd 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:\\nan he had stayed by him, I would not have been so\\nfidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold\\nthat's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nGood ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate\\nhas letters from the general, wherein he gives my\\nson the whole name of the war: he hath in this\\naction outdone his former deeds doubly\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nIn troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his\\ntrue purchasing.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nThe gods grant them true!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nTrue! pow, wow.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nTrue! I'll be sworn they are true.\\nWhere is he wounded?\\nGod save your good worships! Marcius is coming\\nhome: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be\\nlarge cicatrices to show the people, when he shall\\nstand for his place. He received in the repulse of\\nTarquin seven hurts i' the body.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nOne i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's\\nnine that I know.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nHe had, before this last expedition, twenty-five\\nwounds upon him.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNow it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.\\nHark! the trumpets.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nThese are the ushers of Marcius: before him he\\ncarries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:\\nDeath, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;\\nWhich, being advanced, declines, and then men die.\\n\\nHerald:\\nKnow, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight\\nWithin Corioli gates: where he hath won,\\nWith fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these\\nIn honour follows Coriolanus.\\nWelcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!\\n\\nAll:\\nWelcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo more of this; it does offend my heart:\\nPray now, no more.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nLook, sir, your mother!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nO,\\nYou have, I know, petition'd all the gods\\nFor my prosperity!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nNay, my good soldier, up;\\nMy gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and\\nBy deed-achieving honour newly named,--\\nWhat is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--\\nBut O, thy wife!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMy gracious silence, hail!\\nWouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,\\nThat weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,\\nSuch eyes the widows in Corioli wear,\\nAnd mothers that lack sons.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNow, the gods crown thee!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAnd live you yet?\\nO my sweet lady, pardon.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI know not where to turn: O, welcome home:\\nAnd welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nA hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep\\nAnd I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.\\nA curse begin at very root on's heart,\\nThat is not glad to see thee! You are three\\nThat Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,\\nWe have some old crab-trees here\\nat home that will not\\nBe grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:\\nWe call a nettle but a nettle and\\nThe faults of fools but folly.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nEver right.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMenenius ever, ever.\\n\\nHerald:\\nGive way there, and go on!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI have lived\\nTo see inherited my very wishes\\nAnd the buildings of my fancy: only\\nThere's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but\\nOur Rome will cast upon thee.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nKnow, good mother,\\nI had rather be their servant in my way,\\nThan sway with them in theirs.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nOn, to the Capitol!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nAll tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights\\nAre spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse\\nInto a rapture lets her baby cry\\nWhile she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins\\nHer richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,\\nClambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,\\nAre smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed\\nWith variable complexions, all agreeing\\nIn earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens\\nDo press among the popular throngs and puff\\nTo win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames\\nCommit the war of white and damask in\\nTheir nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil\\nOf Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother\\nAs if that whatsoever god who leads him\\nWere slily crept into his human powers\\nAnd gave him graceful posture.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nOn the sudden,\\nI warrant him consul.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThen our office may,\\nDuring his power, go sleep.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHe cannot temperately transport his honours\\nFrom where he should begin and end, but will\\nLose those he hath won.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nIn that there's comfort.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nDoubt not\\nThe commoners, for whom we stand, but they\\nUpon their ancient malice will forget\\nWith the least cause these his new honours, which\\nThat he will give them make I as little question\\nAs he is proud to do't.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nI heard him swear,\\nWere he to stand for consul, never would he\\nAppear i' the market-place nor on him put\\nThe napless vesture of humility;\\nNor showing, as the manner is, his wounds\\nTo the people, beg their stinking breaths.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\n'Tis right.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nIt was his word: O, he would miss it rather\\nThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,\\nAnd the desire of the nobles.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nI wish no better\\nThan have him hold that purpose and to put it\\nIn execution.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\n'Tis most like he will.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nIt shall be to him then as our good wills,\\nA sure destruction.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nSo it must fall out\\nTo him or our authorities. For an end,\\nWe must suggest the people in what hatred\\nHe still hath held them; that to's power he would\\nHave made them mules, silenced their pleaders and\\nDispropertied their freedoms, holding them,\\nIn human action and capacity,\\nOf no more soul nor fitness for the world\\nThan camels in the war, who have their provand\\nOnly for bearing burdens, and sore blows\\nFor sinking under them.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis, as you say, suggested\\nAt some time when his soaring insolence\\nShall touch the people--which time shall not want,\\nIf he be put upon 't; and that's as easy\\nAs to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire\\nTo kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze\\nShall darken him for ever.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWhat's the matter?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nYou are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought\\nThat Marcius shall be consul:\\nI have seen the dumb men throng to see him and\\nThe blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,\\nLadies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,\\nUpon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,\\nAs to Jove's statue, and the commons made\\nA shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:\\nI never saw the like.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLet's to the Capitol;\\nAnd carry with us ears and eyes for the time,\\nBut hearts for the event.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHave with you.\\n\\nFirst Officer:\\nCome, come, they are almost here. How many stand\\nfor consulships?\\n\\nSecond Officer:\\nThree, they say: but 'tis thought of every one\\nCoriolanus will carry it.\\n\\nFirst Officer:\\nThat's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and\\nloves not the common people.\\n\\nSecond Officer:\\nFaith, there had been many great men that have\\nflattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there\\nbe many that they have loved, they know not\\nwherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,\\nthey hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for\\nCoriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate\\nhim manifests the true knowledge he has in their\\ndisposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets\\nthem plainly see't.\\n\\nFirst Officer:\\nIf he did not care whether he had their love or no,\\nhe waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither\\ngood nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater\\ndevotion than can render it him; and leaves\\nnothing undone that may fully discover him their\\nopposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and\\ndispleasure of the people is as bad as that which he\\ndislikes, to flatter them for their love.\\n\\nSecond Officer:\\nHe hath deserved worthily of his country: and his\\nascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,\\nhaving been supple and courteous to the people,\\nbonneted, without any further deed to have them at\\nan into their estimation and report: but he hath so\\nplanted his honours in their eyes, and his actions\\nin their hearts, that for their tongues to be\\nsilent, and not confess so much, were a kind of\\ningrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a\\nmalice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck\\nreproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.\\n\\nFirst Officer:\\nNo more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they\\nare coming.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHaving determined of the Volsces and\\nTo send for Titus Lartius, it remains,\\nAs the main point of this our after-meeting,\\nTo gratify his noble service that\\nHath thus stood for his country: therefore,\\nplease you,\\nMost reverend and grave elders, to desire\\nThe present consul, and last general\\nIn our well-found successes, to report\\nA little of that worthy work perform'd\\nBy Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom\\nWe met here both to thank and to remember\\nWith honours like himself.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nSpeak, good Cominius:\\nLeave nothing out for length, and make us think\\nRather our state's defective for requital\\nThan we to stretch it out.\\nMasters o' the people,\\nWe do request your kindest ears, and after,\\nYour loving motion toward the common body,\\nTo yield what passes here.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe are convented\\nUpon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts\\nInclinable to honour and advance\\nThe theme of our assembly.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWhich the rather\\nWe shall be blest to do, if he remember\\nA kinder value of the people than\\nHe hath hereto prized them at.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThat's off, that's off;\\nI would you rather had been silent. Please you\\nTo hear Cominius speak?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nMost willingly;\\nBut yet my caution was more pertinent\\nThan the rebuke you give it.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHe loves your people\\nBut tie him not to be their bedfellow.\\nWorthy Cominius, speak.\\nNay, keep your place.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nSit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear\\nWhat you have nobly done.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYour horror's pardon:\\nI had rather have my wounds to heal again\\nThan hear say how I got them.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nSir, I hope\\nMy words disbench'd you not.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo, sir: yet oft,\\nWhen blows have made me stay, I fled from words.\\nYou soothed not, therefore hurt not: but\\nyour people,\\nI love them as they weigh.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPray now, sit down.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun\\nWhen the alarum were struck than idly sit\\nTo hear my nothings monster'd.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nMasters of the people,\\nYour multiplying spawn how can he flatter--\\nThat's thousand to one good one--when you now see\\nHe had rather venture all his limbs for honour\\nThan one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus\\nShould not be utter'd feebly. It is held\\nThat valour is the chiefest virtue, and\\nMost dignifies the haver: if it be,\\nThe man I speak of cannot in the world\\nBe singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,\\nWhen Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought\\nBeyond the mark of others: our then dictator,\\nWhom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,\\nWhen with his Amazonian chin he drove\\nThe bristled lips before him: be bestrid\\nAn o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view\\nSlew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,\\nAnd struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,\\nWhen he might act the woman in the scene,\\nHe proved best man i' the field, and for his meed\\nWas brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age\\nMan-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,\\nAnd in the brunt of seventeen battles since\\nHe lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,\\nBefore and in Corioli, let me say,\\nI cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;\\nAnd by his rare example made the coward\\nTurn terror into sport: as weeds before\\nA vessel under sail, so men obey'd\\nAnd fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,\\nWhere it did mark, it took; from face to foot\\nHe was a thing of blood, whose every motion\\nWas timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd\\nThe mortal gate of the city, which he painted\\nWith shunless destiny; aidless came off,\\nAnd with a sudden reinforcement struck\\nCorioli like a planet: now all's his:\\nWhen, by and by, the din of war gan pierce\\nHis ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit\\nRe-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,\\nAnd to the battle came he; where he did\\nRun reeking o'er the lives of men, as if\\n'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd\\nBoth field and city ours, he never stood\\nTo ease his breast with panting.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWorthy man!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nHe cannot but with measure fit the honours\\nWhich we devise him.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nOur spoils he kick'd at,\\nAnd look'd upon things precious as they were\\nThe common muck of the world: he covets less\\nThan misery itself would give; rewards\\nHis deeds with doing them, and is content\\nTo spend the time to end it.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHe's right noble:\\nLet him be call'd for.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nCall Coriolanus.\\n\\nOfficer:\\nHe doth appear.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased\\nTo make thee consul.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI do owe them still\\nMy life and services.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nIt then remains\\nThat you do speak to the people.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI do beseech you,\\nLet me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot\\nPut on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,\\nFor my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you\\nThat I may pass this doing.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nSir, the people\\nMust have their voices; neither will they bate\\nOne jot of ceremony.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPut them not to't:\\nPray you, go fit you to the custom and\\nTake to you, as your predecessors have,\\nYour honour with your form.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nIt is apart\\nThat I shall blush in acting, and might well\\nBe taken from the people.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nMark you that?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTo brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;\\nShow them the unaching scars which I should hide,\\nAs if I had received them for the hire\\nOf their breath only!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nDo not stand upon't.\\nWe recommend to you, tribunes of the people,\\nOur purpose to them: and to our noble consul\\nWish we all joy and honour.\\n\\nSenators:\\nTo Coriolanus come all joy and honour!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nYou see how he intends to use the people.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nMay they perceive's intent! He will require them,\\nAs if he did contemn what he requested\\nShould be in them to give.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCome, we'll inform them\\nOf our proceedings here: on the marketplace,\\nI know, they do attend us.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nOnce, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nWe may, sir, if we will.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nWe have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a\\npower that we have no power to do; for if he show us\\nhis wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our\\ntongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if\\nhe tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him\\nour noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is\\nmonstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,\\nwere to make a monster of the multitude: of the\\nwhich we being members, should bring ourselves to be\\nmonstrous members.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nAnd to make us no better thought of, a little help\\nwill serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he\\nhimself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nWe have been called so of many; not that our heads\\nare some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,\\nbut that our wits are so diversely coloured: and\\ntruly I think if all our wits were to issue out of\\none skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,\\nand their consent of one direct way should be at\\nonce to all the points o' the compass.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nThink you so? Which way do you judge my wit would\\nfly?\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nNay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's\\nwill;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but\\nif it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nWhy that way?\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nTo lose itself in a fog, where being three parts\\nmelted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return\\nfor conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nYou are never without your tricks: you may, you may.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nAre you all resolved to give your voices? But\\nthat's no matter, the greater part carries it. I\\nsay, if he would incline to the people, there was\\nnever a worthier man.\\nHere he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his\\nbehavior. We are not to stay all together, but to\\ncome by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and\\nby threes. He's to make his requests by\\nparticulars; wherein every one of us has a single\\nhonour, in giving him our own voices with our own\\ntongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how\\nyou shall go by him.\\n\\nAll:\\nContent, content.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nO sir, you are not right: have you not known\\nThe worthiest men have done't?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat must I say?\\n'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring\\nMy tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!\\nI got them in my country's service, when\\nSome certain of your brethren roar'd and ran\\nFrom the noise of our own drums.'\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nO me, the gods!\\nYou must not speak of that: you must desire them\\nTo think upon you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThink upon me! hang 'em!\\nI would they would forget me, like the virtues\\nWhich our divines lose by 'em.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou'll mar all:\\nI'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,\\nIn wholesome manner.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nBid them wash their faces\\nAnd keep their teeth clean.\\nSo, here comes a brace.\\nYou know the cause, air, of my standing here.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nWe do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMine own desert.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nYour own desert!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAy, but not mine own desire.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nHow not your own desire?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the\\npoor with begging.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nYou must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to\\ngain by you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWell then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nThe price is to ask it kindly.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nKindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to\\nshow you, which shall be yours in private. Your\\ngood voice, sir; what say you?\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nYou shall ha' it, worthy sir.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nA match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices\\nbegged. I have your alms: adieu.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nBut this is something odd.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nAn 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nPray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your\\nvoices that I may be consul, I have here the\\ncustomary gown.\\n\\nFourth Citizen:\\nYou have deserved nobly of your country, and you\\nhave not deserved nobly.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYour enigma?\\n\\nFourth Citizen:\\nYou have been a scourge to her enemies, you have\\nbeen a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved\\nthe common people.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYou should account me the more virtuous that I have\\nnot been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my\\nsworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer\\nestimation of them; 'tis a condition they account\\ngentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is\\nrather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise\\nthe insinuating nod and be off to them most\\ncounterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the\\nbewitchment of some popular man and give it\\nbountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,\\nI may be consul.\\n\\nFifth Citizen:\\nWe hope to find you our friend; and therefore give\\nyou our voices heartily.\\n\\nFourth Citizen:\\nYou have received many wounds for your country.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I\\nwill make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.\\n\\nBoth Citizens:\\nThe gods give you joy, sir, heartily!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMost sweet voices!\\nBetter it is to die, better to starve,\\nThan crave the hire which first we do deserve.\\nWhy in this woolvish toge should I stand here,\\nTo beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,\\nTheir needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:\\nWhat custom wills, in all things should we do't,\\nThe dust on antique time would lie unswept,\\nAnd mountainous error be too highly heapt\\nFor truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,\\nLet the high office and the honour go\\nTo one that would do thus. I am half through;\\nThe one part suffer'd, the other will I do.\\nHere come more voices.\\nYour voices: for your voices I have fought;\\nWatch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear\\nOf wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six\\nI have seen and heard of; for your voices have\\nDone many things, some less, some more your voices:\\nIndeed I would be consul.\\n\\nSixth Citizen:\\nHe has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest\\nman's voice.\\n\\nSeventh Citizen:\\nTherefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,\\nand make him good friend to the people!\\n\\nAll Citizens:\\nAmen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWorthy voices!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou have stood your limitation; and the tribunes\\nEndue you with the people's voice: remains\\nThat, in the official marks invested, you\\nAnon do meet the senate.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nIs this done?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThe custom of request you have discharged:\\nThe people do admit you, and are summon'd\\nTo meet anon, upon your approbation.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhere? at the senate-house?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThere, Coriolanus.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMay I change these garments?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYou may, sir.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThat I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,\\nRepair to the senate-house.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI'll keep you company. Will you along?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWe stay here for the people.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nFare you well.\\nHe has it now, and by his looks methink\\n'Tis warm at 's heart.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWith a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.\\nwill you dismiss the people?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHow now, my masters! have you chose this man?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nHe has our voices, sir.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWe pray the gods he may deserve your loves.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nAmen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,\\nHe mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nCertainly\\nHe flouted us downright.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nNo,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nNot one amongst us, save yourself, but says\\nHe used us scornfully: he should have show'd us\\nHis marks of merit, wounds received for's country.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhy, so he did, I am sure.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nNo, no; no man saw 'em.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nHe said he had wounds, which he could show\\nin private;\\nAnd with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,\\n'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,\\nBut by your voices, will not so permit me;\\nYour voices therefore.' When we granted that,\\nHere was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:\\nYour most sweet voices: now you have left\\nyour voices,\\nI have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhy either were you ignorant to see't,\\nOr, seeing it, of such childish friendliness\\nTo yield your voices?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCould you not have told him\\nAs you were lesson'd, when he had no power,\\nBut was a petty servant to the state,\\nHe was your enemy, ever spake against\\nYour liberties and the charters that you bear\\nI' the body of the weal; and now, arriving\\nA place of potency and sway o' the state,\\nIf he should still malignantly remain\\nFast foe to the plebeii, your voices might\\nBe curses to yourselves? You should have said\\nThat as his worthy deeds did claim no less\\nThan what he stood for, so his gracious nature\\nWould think upon you for your voices and\\nTranslate his malice towards you into love,\\nStanding your friendly lord.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThus to have said,\\nAs you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit\\nAnd tried his inclination; from him pluck'd\\nEither his gracious promise, which you might,\\nAs cause had call'd you up, have held him to\\nOr else it would have gall'd his surly nature,\\nWhich easily endures not article\\nTying him to aught; so putting him to rage,\\nYou should have ta'en the advantage of his choler\\nAnd pass'd him unelected.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nDid you perceive\\nHe did solicit you in free contempt\\nWhen he did need your loves, and do you think\\nThat his contempt shall not be bruising to you,\\nWhen he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies\\nNo heart among you? or had you tongues to cry\\nAgainst the rectorship of judgment?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHave you\\nEre now denied the asker? and now again\\nOf him that did not ask, but mock, bestow\\nYour sued-for tongues?\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nHe's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nAnd will deny him:\\nI'll have five hundred voices of that sound.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nI twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGet you hence instantly, and tell those friends,\\nThey have chose a consul that will from them take\\nTheir liberties; make them of no more voice\\nThan dogs that are as often beat for barking\\nAs therefore kept to do so.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nLet them assemble,\\nAnd on a safer judgment all revoke\\nYour ignorant election; enforce his pride,\\nAnd his old hate unto you; besides, forget not\\nWith what contempt he wore the humble weed,\\nHow in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,\\nThinking upon his services, took from you\\nThe apprehension of his present portance,\\nWhich most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion\\nAfter the inveterate hate he bears you.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLay\\nA fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,\\nNo impediment between, but that you must\\nCast your election on him.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nSay, you chose him\\nMore after our commandment than as guided\\nBy your own true affections, and that your minds,\\nPreoccupied with what you rather must do\\nThan what you should, made you against the grain\\nTo voice him consul: lay the fault on us.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nAy, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.\\nHow youngly he began to serve his country,\\nHow long continued, and what stock he springs of,\\nThe noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came\\nThat Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,\\nWho, after great Hostilius, here was king;\\nOf the same house Publius and Quintus were,\\nThat our beat water brought by conduits hither;\\nAnd  \\nTwice being  \\nWas his great ancestor.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nOne thus descended,\\nThat hath beside well in his person wrought\\nTo be set high in place, we did commend\\nTo your remembrances: but you have found,\\nScaling his present bearing with his past,\\nThat he's your fixed enemy, and revoke\\nYour sudden approbation.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nSay, you ne'er had done't--\\nHarp on that still--but by our putting on;\\nAnd presently, when you have drawn your number,\\nRepair to the Capitol.\\n\\nAll:\\nWe will so: almost all\\nRepent in their election.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLet them go on;\\nThis mutiny were better put in hazard,\\nThan stay, past doubt, for greater:\\nIf, as his nature is, he fall in rage\\nWith their refusal, both observe and answer\\nThe vantage of his anger.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nTo the Capitol, come:\\nWe will be there before the stream o' the people;\\nAnd this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,\\nWhich we have goaded onward.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTullus Aufidius then had made new head?\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nHe had, my lord; and that it was which caused\\nOur swifter composition.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nSo then the Volsces stand but as at first,\\nReady, when time shall prompt them, to make road.\\nUpon's again.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThey are worn, lord consul, so,\\nThat we shall hardly in our ages see\\nTheir banners wave again.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nSaw you Aufidius?\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nOn safe-guard he came to me; and did curse\\nAgainst the Volsces, for they had so vilely\\nYielded the town: he is retired to Antium.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nSpoke he of me?\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nHe did, my lord.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHow? what?\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nHow often he had met you, sword to sword;\\nThat of all things upon the earth he hated\\nYour person most, that he would pawn his fortunes\\nTo hopeless restitution, so he might\\nBe call'd your vanquisher.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAt Antium lives he?\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nAt Antium.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI wish I had a cause to seek him there,\\nTo oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.\\nBehold, these are the tribunes of the people,\\nThe tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;\\nFor they do prank them in authority,\\nAgainst all noble sufferance.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nPass no further.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHa! what is that?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nIt will be dangerous to go on: no further.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat makes this change?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe matter?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHath he not pass'd the noble and the common?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCominius, no.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHave I had children's voices?\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nTribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThe people are incensed against him.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nStop,\\nOr all will fall in broil.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAre these your herd?\\nMust these have voices, that can yield them now\\nAnd straight disclaim their tongues? What are\\nyour offices?\\nYou being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?\\nHave you not set them on?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nBe calm, be calm.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nIt is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,\\nTo curb the will of the nobility:\\nSuffer't, and live with such as cannot rule\\nNor ever will be ruled.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCall't not a plot:\\nThe people cry you mock'd them, and of late,\\nWhen corn was given them gratis, you repined;\\nScandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them\\nTime-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhy, this was known before.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nNot to them all.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHave you inform'd them sithence?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHow! I inform them!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYou are like to do such business.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nNot unlike,\\nEach way, to better yours.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhy then should I be consul? By yond clouds,\\nLet me deserve so ill as you, and make me\\nYour fellow tribune.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYou show too much of that\\nFor which the people stir: if you will pass\\nTo where you are bound, you must inquire your way,\\nWhich you are out of, with a gentler spirit,\\nOr never be so noble as a consul,\\nNor yoke with him for tribune.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nLet's be calm.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThe people are abused; set on. This paltering\\nBecomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus\\nDeserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely\\nI' the plain way of his merit.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTell me of corn!\\nThis was my speech, and I will speak't again--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNot now, not now.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nNot in this heat, sir, now.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNow, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,\\nI crave their pardons:\\nFor the mutable, rank-scented many, let them\\nRegard me as I do not flatter, and\\nTherein behold themselves: I say again,\\nIn soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate\\nThe cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,\\nWhich we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,\\nand scatter'd,\\nBy mingling them with us, the honour'd number,\\nWho lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that\\nWhich they have given to beggars.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWell, no more.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nNo more words, we beseech you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHow! no more!\\nAs for my country I have shed my blood,\\nNot fearing outward force, so shall my lungs\\nCoin words till their decay against those measles,\\nWhich we disdain should tatter us, yet sought\\nThe very way to catch them.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nYou speak o' the people,\\nAs if you were a god to punish, not\\nA man of their infirmity.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\n'Twere well\\nWe let the people know't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat, what? his choler?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nCholer!\\nWere I as patient as the midnight sleep,\\nBy Jove, 'twould be my mind!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nIt is a mind\\nThat shall remain a poison where it is,\\nNot poison any further.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nShall remain!\\nHear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you\\nHis absolute 'shall'?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\n'Twas from the canon.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\n'Shall'!\\nO good but most unwise patricians! why,\\nYou grave but reckless senators, have you thus\\nGiven Hydra here to choose an officer,\\nThat with his peremptory 'shall,' being but\\nThe horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit\\nTo say he'll turn your current in a ditch,\\nAnd make your channel his? If he have power\\nThen vail your ignorance; if none, awake\\nYour dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,\\nBe not as common fools; if you are not,\\nLet them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,\\nIf they be senators: and they are no less,\\nWhen, both your voices blended, the great'st taste\\nMost palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,\\nAnd such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'\\nHis popular 'shall' against a graver bench\\nThan ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!\\nIt makes the consuls base: and my soul aches\\nTo know, when two authorities are up,\\nNeither supreme, how soon confusion\\nMay enter 'twixt the gap of both and take\\nThe one by the other.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nWell, on to the market-place.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhoever gave that counsel, to give forth\\nThe corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used\\nSometime in Greece,--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWell, well, no more of that.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThough there the people had more absolute power,\\nI say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed\\nThe ruin of the state.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWhy, shall the people give\\nOne that speaks thus their voice?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI'll give my reasons,\\nMore worthier than their voices. They know the corn\\nWas not our recompense, resting well assured\\nThat ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,\\nEven when the navel of the state was touch'd,\\nThey would not thread the gates. This kind of service\\nDid not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war\\nTheir mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd\\nMost valour, spoke not for them: the accusation\\nWhich they have often made against the senate,\\nAll cause unborn, could never be the motive\\nOf our so frank donation. Well, what then?\\nHow shall this bisson multitude digest\\nThe senate's courtesy? Let deeds express\\nWhat's like to be their words: 'we did request it;\\nWe are the greater poll, and in true fear\\nThey gave us our demands.' Thus we debase\\nThe nature of our seats and make the rabble\\nCall our cares fears; which will in time\\nBreak ope the locks o' the senate and bring in\\nThe crows to peck the eagles.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nCome, enough.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nEnough, with over-measure.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo, take more:\\nWhat may be sworn by, both divine and human,\\nSeal what I end withal! This double worship,\\nWhere one part does disdain with cause, the other\\nInsult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,\\nCannot conclude but by the yea and no\\nOf general ignorance,--it must omit\\nReal necessities, and give way the while\\nTo unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,\\nit follows,\\nNothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--\\nYou that will be less fearful than discreet,\\nThat love the fundamental part of state\\nMore than you doubt the change on't, that prefer\\nA noble life before a long, and wish\\nTo jump a body with a dangerous physic\\nThat's sure of death without it, at once pluck out\\nThe multitudinous tongue; let them not lick\\nThe sweet which is their poison: your dishonour\\nMangles true judgment and bereaves the state\\nOf that integrity which should become't,\\nNot having the power to do the good it would,\\nFor the in which doth control't.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHas said enough.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHas spoken like a traitor, and shall answer\\nAs traitors do.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!\\nWhat should the people do with these bald tribunes?\\nOn whom depending, their obedience fails\\nTo the greater bench: in a rebellion,\\nWhen what's not meet, but what must be, was law,\\nThen were they chosen: in a better hour,\\nLet what is meet be said it must be meet,\\nAnd throw their power i' the dust.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nManifest treason!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis a consul? no.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThe aediles, ho!\\nLet him be apprehended.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nGo, call the people:\\nin whose name myself\\nAttach thee as a traitorous innovator,\\nA foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,\\nAnd follow to thine answer.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHence, old goat!\\n\\nSenators, &C:\\nWe'll surety him.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nAged sir, hands off.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones\\nOut of thy garments.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHelp, ye citizens!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nOn both sides more respect.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHere's he that would take from you all your power.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nSeize him, AEdiles!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nDown with him! down with him!\\n\\nSenators, &C:\\nWeapons, weapons, weapons!\\n'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'\\n'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'\\n'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat is about to be? I am out of breath;\\nConfusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes\\nTo the people! Coriolanus, patience!\\nSpeak, good Sicinius.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHear me, people; peace!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nLet's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYou are at point to lose your liberties:\\nMarcius would have all from you; Marcius,\\nWhom late you have named for consul.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFie, fie, fie!\\nThis is the way to kindle, not to quench.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nTo unbuild the city and to lay all flat.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhat is the city but the people?\\n\\nCitizens:\\nTrue,\\nThe people are the city.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nBy the consent of all, we were establish'd\\nThe people's magistrates.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nYou so remain.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAnd so are like to do.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThat is the way to lay the city flat;\\nTo bring the roof to the foundation,\\nAnd bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,\\nIn heaps and piles of ruin.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis deserves death.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nOr let us stand to our authority,\\nOr let us lose it. We do here pronounce,\\nUpon the part o' the people, in whose power\\nWe were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy\\nOf present death.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nTherefore lay hold of him;\\nBear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence\\nInto destruction cast him.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nAEdiles, seize him!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nYield, Marcius, yield!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHear me one word;\\nBeseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nPeace, peace!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nSir, those cold ways,\\nThat seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous\\nWhere the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,\\nAnd bear him to the rock.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo, I'll die here.\\nThere's some among you have beheld me fighting:\\nCome, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nDown with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLay hands upon him.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHelp Marcius, help,\\nYou that be noble; help him, young and old!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nDown with him, down with him!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nGo, get you to your house; be gone, away!\\nAll will be naught else.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nGet you gone.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nStand fast;\\nWe have as many friends as enemies.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSham it be put to that?\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nThe gods forbid!\\nI prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;\\nLeave us to cure this cause.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFor 'tis a sore upon us,\\nYou cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nCome, sir, along with us.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI would they were barbarians--as they are,\\nThough in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,\\nThough calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nBe gone;\\nPut not your worthy rage into your tongue;\\nOne time will owe another.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nOn fair ground\\nI could beat forty of them.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI could myself\\nTake up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the\\ntwo tribunes:\\nBut now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;\\nAnd manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands\\nAgainst a falling fabric. Will you hence,\\nBefore the tag return? whose rage doth rend\\nLike interrupted waters and o'erbear\\nWhat they are used to bear.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPray you, be gone:\\nI'll try whether my old wit be in request\\nWith those that have but little: this must be patch'd\\nWith cloth of any colour.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nNay, come away.\\n\\nA Patrician:\\nThis man has marr'd his fortune.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHis nature is too noble for the world:\\nHe would not flatter Neptune for his trident,\\nOr Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:\\nWhat his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;\\nAnd, being angry, does forget that ever\\nHe heard the name of death.\\nHere's goodly work!\\n\\nSecond Patrician:\\nI would they were abed!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!\\nCould he not speak 'em fair?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhere is this viper\\nThat would depopulate the city and\\nBe every man himself?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou worthy tribunes,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHe shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock\\nWith rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,\\nAnd therefore law shall scorn him further trial\\nThan the severity of the public power\\nWhich he so sets at nought.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nHe shall well know\\nThe noble tribunes are the people's mouths,\\nAnd we their hands.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nHe shall, sure on't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSir, sir,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nPeace!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nDo not cry havoc, where you should but hunt\\nWith modest warrant.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nSir, how comes't that you\\nHave holp to make this rescue?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHear me speak:\\nAs I do know the consul's worthiness,\\nSo can I name his faults,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nConsul! what consul?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe consul Coriolanus.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHe consul!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nNo, no, no, no, no.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nIf, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,\\nI may be heard, I would crave a word or two;\\nThe which shall turn you to no further harm\\nThan so much loss of time.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nSpeak briefly then;\\nFor we are peremptory to dispatch\\nThis viperous traitor: to eject him hence\\nWere but one danger, and to keep him here\\nOur certain death: therefore it is decreed\\nHe dies to-night.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNow the good gods forbid\\nThat our renowned Rome, whose gratitude\\nTowards her deserved children is enroll'd\\nIn Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam\\nShould now eat up her own!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHe's a disease that must be cut away.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nO, he's a limb that has but a disease;\\nMortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.\\nWhat has he done to Rome that's worthy death?\\nKilling our enemies, the blood he hath lost--\\nWhich, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,\\nBy many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;\\nAnd what is left, to lose it by his country,\\nWere to us all, that do't and suffer it,\\nA brand to the end o' the world.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis is clean kam.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nMerely awry: when he did love his country,\\nIt honour'd him.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe service of the foot\\nBeing once gangrened, is not then respected\\nFor what before it was.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWe'll hear no more.\\nPursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:\\nLest his infection, being of catching nature,\\nSpread further.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nOne word more, one word.\\nThis tiger-footed rage, when it shall find\\nThe harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late\\nTie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;\\nLest parties, as he is beloved, break out,\\nAnd sack great Rome with Romans.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nIf it were so,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhat do ye talk?\\nHave we not had a taste of his obedience?\\nOur aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nConsider this: he has been bred i' the wars\\nSince he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd\\nIn bolted language; meal and bran together\\nHe throws without distinction. Give me leave,\\nI'll go to him, and undertake to bring him\\nWhere he shall answer, by a lawful form,\\nIn peace, to his utmost peril.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nNoble tribunes,\\nIt is the humane way: the other course\\nWill prove too bloody, and the end of it\\nUnknown to the beginning.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNoble Menenius,\\nBe you then as the people's officer.\\nMasters, lay down your weapons.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGo not home.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nMeet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:\\nWhere, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed\\nIn our first way.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI'll bring him to you.\\nLet me desire your company: he must come,\\nOr what is worst will follow.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nPray you, let's to him.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nLet them puff all about mine ears, present me\\nDeath on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,\\nOr pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,\\nThat the precipitation might down stretch\\nBelow the beam of sight, yet will I still\\nBe thus to them.\\n\\nA Patrician:\\nYou do the nobler.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI muse my mother\\nDoes not approve me further, who was wont\\nTo call them woollen vassals, things created\\nTo buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads\\nIn congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,\\nWhen one but of my ordinance stood up\\nTo speak of peace or war.\\nI talk of you:\\nWhy did you wish me milder? would you have me\\nFalse to my nature? Rather say I play\\nThe man I am.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nO, sir, sir, sir,\\nI would have had you put your power well on,\\nBefore you had worn it out.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nLet go.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nYou might have been enough the man you are,\\nWith striving less to be so; lesser had been\\nThe thwartings of your dispositions, if\\nYou had not show'd them how ye were disposed\\nEre they lack'd power to cross you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nLet them hang.\\n\\nA Patrician:\\nAy, and burn too.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nCome, come, you have been too rough, something\\ntoo rough;\\nYou must return and mend it.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nThere's no remedy;\\nUnless, by not so doing, our good city\\nCleave in the midst, and perish.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nPray, be counsell'd:\\nI have a heart as little apt as yours,\\nBut yet a brain that leads my use of anger\\nTo better vantage.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWell said, noble woman?\\nBefore he should thus stoop to the herd, but that\\nThe violent fit o' the time craves it as physic\\nFor the whole state, I would put mine armour on,\\nWhich I can scarcely bear.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat must I do?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nReturn to the tribunes.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWell, what then? what then?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nRepent what you have spoke.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nFor them! I cannot do it to the gods;\\nMust I then do't to them?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nYou are too absolute;\\nThough therein you can never be too noble,\\nBut when extremities speak. I have heard you say,\\nHonour and policy, like unsever'd friends,\\nI' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,\\nIn peace what each of them by the other lose,\\nThat they combine not there.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTush, tush!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nA good demand.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nIf it be honour in your wars to seem\\nThe same you are not, which, for your best ends,\\nYou adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,\\nThat it shall hold companionship in peace\\nWith honour, as in war, since that to both\\nIt stands in like request?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhy force you this?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nBecause that now it lies you on to speak\\nTo the people; not by your own instruction,\\nNor by the matter which your heart prompts you,\\nBut with such words that are but rooted in\\nYour tongue, though but bastards and syllables\\nOf no allowance to your bosom's truth.\\nNow, this no more dishonours you at all\\nThan to take in a town with gentle words,\\nWhich else would put you to your fortune and\\nThe hazard of much blood.\\nI would dissemble with my nature where\\nMy fortunes and my friends at stake required\\nI should do so in honour: I am in this,\\nYour wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;\\nAnd you will rather show our general louts\\nHow you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,\\nFor the inheritance of their loves and safeguard\\nOf what that want might ruin.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNoble lady!\\nCome, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,\\nNot what is dangerous present, but the loss\\nOf what is past.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI prithee now, my son,\\nGo to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;\\nAnd thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--\\nThy knee bussing the stones--for in such business\\nAction is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant\\nMore learned than the ears--waving thy head,\\nWhich often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,\\nNow humble as the ripest mulberry\\nThat will not hold the handling: or say to them,\\nThou art their soldier, and being bred in broils\\nHast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,\\nWere fit for thee to use as they to claim,\\nIn asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame\\nThyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far\\nAs thou hast power and person.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThis but done,\\nEven as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;\\nFor they have pardons, being ask'd, as free\\nAs words to little purpose.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nPrithee now,\\nGo, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather\\nFollow thine enemy in a fiery gulf\\nThan flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit\\nYou make strong party, or defend yourself\\nBy calmness or by absence: all's in anger.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nOnly fair speech.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI think 'twill serve, if he\\nCan thereto frame his spirit.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nHe must, and will\\nPrithee now, say you will, and go about it.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMust I go show them my unbarbed sconce?\\nMust I with base tongue give my noble heart\\nA lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:\\nYet, were there but this single plot to lose,\\nThis mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it\\nAnd throw't against the wind. To the market-place!\\nYou have put me now to such a part which never\\nI shall discharge to the life.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nCome, come, we'll prompt you.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said\\nMy praises made thee first a soldier, so,\\nTo have my praise for this, perform a part\\nThou hast not done before.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWell, I must do't:\\nAway, my disposition, and possess me\\nSome harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,\\nWhich quired with my drum, into a pipe\\nSmall as an eunuch, or the virgin voice\\nThat babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves\\nTent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up\\nThe glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue\\nMake motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,\\nWho bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his\\nThat hath received an alms! I will not do't,\\nLest I surcease to honour mine own truth\\nAnd by my body's action teach my mind\\nA most inherent baseness.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nAt thy choice, then:\\nTo beg of thee, it is my more dishonour\\nThan thou of them. Come all to ruin; let\\nThy mother rather feel thy pride than fear\\nThy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death\\nWith as big heart as thou. Do as thou list\\nThy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,\\nBut owe thy pride thyself.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nPray, be content:\\nMother, I am going to the market-place;\\nChide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,\\nCog their hearts from them, and come home beloved\\nOf all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:\\nCommend me to my wife. I'll return consul;\\nOr never trust to what my tongue can do\\nI' the way of flattery further.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nDo your will.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nAway! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself\\nTo answer mildly; for they are prepared\\nWith accusations, as I hear, more strong\\nThan are upon you yet.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThe word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:\\nLet them accuse me by invention, I\\nWill answer in mine honour.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAy, but mildly.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWell, mildly be it then. Mildly!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nIn this point charge him home, that he affects\\nTyrannical power: if he evade us there,\\nEnforce him with his envy to the people,\\nAnd that the spoil got on the Antiates\\nWas ne'er distributed.\\nWhat, will he come?\\n\\nAEdile:\\nHe's coming.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHow accompanied?\\n\\nAEdile:\\nWith old Menenius, and those senators\\nThat always favour'd him.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHave you a catalogue\\nOf all the voices that we have procured\\nSet down by the poll?\\n\\nAEdile:\\nI have; 'tis ready.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHave you collected them by tribes?\\n\\nAEdile:\\nI have.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nAssemble presently the people hither;\\nAnd when they bear me say 'It shall be so\\nI' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either\\nFor death, for fine, or banishment, then let them\\nIf I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'\\nInsisting on the old prerogative\\nAnd power i' the truth o' the cause.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nI shall inform them.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nAnd when such time they have begun to cry,\\nLet them not cease, but with a din confused\\nEnforce the present execution\\nOf what we chance to sentence.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nVery well.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nMake them be strong and ready for this hint,\\nWhen we shall hap to give 't them.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGo about it.\\nPut him to choler straight: he hath been used\\nEver to conquer, and to have his worth\\nOf contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot\\nBe rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks\\nWhat's in his heart; and that is there which looks\\nWith us to break his neck.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWell, here he comes.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nCalmly, I do beseech you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAy, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece\\nWill bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods\\nKeep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice\\nSupplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!\\nThrong our large temples with the shows of peace,\\nAnd not our streets with war!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nAmen, amen.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nA noble wish.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nDraw near, ye people.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nList to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nFirst, hear me speak.\\n\\nBoth Tribunes:\\nWell, say. Peace, ho!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nShall I be charged no further than this present?\\nMust all determine here?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nI do demand,\\nIf you submit you to the people's voices,\\nAllow their officers and are content\\nTo suffer lawful censure for such faults\\nAs shall be proved upon you?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI am content.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nLo, citizens, he says he is content:\\nThe warlike service he has done, consider; think\\nUpon the wounds his body bears, which show\\nLike graves i' the holy churchyard.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nScratches with briers,\\nScars to move laughter only.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nConsider further,\\nThat when he speaks not like a citizen,\\nYou find him like a soldier: do not take\\nHis rougher accents for malicious sounds,\\nBut, as I say, such as become a soldier,\\nRather than envy you.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nWell, well, no more.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat is the matter\\nThat being pass'd for consul with full voice,\\nI am so dishonour'd that the very hour\\nYou take it off again?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nAnswer to us.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nSay, then: 'tis true, I ought so.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe charge you, that you have contrived to take\\nFrom Rome all season'd office and to wind\\nYourself into a power tyrannical;\\nFor which you are a traitor to the people.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHow! traitor!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNay, temperately; your promise.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThe fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!\\nCall me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!\\nWithin thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,\\nIn thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in\\nThy lying tongue both numbers, I would say\\n'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free\\nAs I do pray the gods.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nMark you this, people?\\n\\nCitizens:\\nTo the rock, to the rock with him!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nPeace!\\nWe need not put new matter to his charge:\\nWhat you have seen him do and heard him speak,\\nBeating your officers, cursing yourselves,\\nOpposing laws with strokes and here defying\\nThose whose great power must try him; even this,\\nSo criminal and in such capital kind,\\nDeserves the extremest death.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nBut since he hath\\nServed well for Rome,--\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat do you prate of service?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nI talk of that, that know it.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYou?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nIs this the promise that you made your mother?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nKnow, I pray you,--\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI know no further:\\nLet them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,\\nVagabond exile, raying, pent to linger\\nBut with a grain a day, I would not buy\\nTheir mercy at the price of one fair word;\\nNor cheque my courage for what they can give,\\nTo have't with saying 'Good morrow.'\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nFor that he has,\\nAs much as in him lies, from time to time\\nEnvied against the people, seeking means\\nTo pluck away their power, as now at last\\nGiven hostile strokes, and that not in the presence\\nOf dreaded justice, but on the ministers\\nThat do distribute it; in the name o' the people\\nAnd in the power of us the tribunes, we,\\nEven from this instant, banish him our city,\\nIn peril of precipitation\\nFrom off the rock Tarpeian never more\\nTo enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,\\nI say it shall be so.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nIt shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:\\nHe's banish'd, and it shall be so.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHear me, my masters, and my common friends,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHe's sentenced; no more hearing.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nLet me speak:\\nI have been consul, and can show for Rome\\nHer enemies' marks upon me. I do love\\nMy country's good with a respect more tender,\\nMore holy and profound, than mine own life,\\nMy dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,\\nAnd treasure of my loins; then if I would\\nSpeak that,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe know your drift: speak what?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThere's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,\\nAs enemy to the people and his country:\\nIt shall be so.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nIt shall be so, it shall be so.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYou common cry of curs! whose breath I hate\\nAs reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize\\nAs the dead carcasses of unburied men\\nThat do corrupt my air, I banish you;\\nAnd here remain with your uncertainty!\\nLet every feeble rumour shake your hearts!\\nYour enemies, with nodding of their plumes,\\nFan you into despair! Have the power still\\nTo banish your defenders; till at length\\nYour ignorance, which finds not till it feels,\\nMaking not reservation of yourselves,\\nStill your own foes, deliver you as most\\nAbated captives to some nation\\nThat won you without blows! Despising,\\nFor you, the city, thus I turn my back:\\nThere is a world elsewhere.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nThe people's enemy is gone, is gone!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nOur enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nGo, see him out at gates, and follow him,\\nAs he hath followed you, with all despite;\\nGive him deserved vexation. Let a guard\\nAttend us through the city.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nCome, come; let's see him out at gates; come.\\nThe gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nCome, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast\\nWith many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,\\nWhere is your ancient courage? you were used\\nTo say extremity was the trier of spirits;\\nThat common chances common men could bear;\\nThat when the sea was calm all boats alike\\nShow'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,\\nWhen most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves\\nA noble cunning: you were used to load me\\nWith precepts that would make invincible\\nThe heart that conn'd them.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nO heavens! O heavens!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNay! prithee, woman,--\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nNow the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,\\nAnd occupations perish!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat, what, what!\\nI shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.\\nResume that spirit, when you were wont to say,\\nIf you had been the wife of Hercules,\\nSix of his labours you'ld have done, and saved\\nYour husband so much sweat. Cominius,\\nDroop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:\\nI'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,\\nThy tears are salter than a younger man's,\\nAnd venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,\\nI have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld\\nHeart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women\\n'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,\\nAs 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well\\nMy hazards still have been your solace: and\\nBelieve't not lightly--though I go alone,\\nLike to a lonely dragon, that his fen\\nMakes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son\\nWill or exceed the common or be caught\\nWith cautelous baits and practise.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nMy first son.\\nWhither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius\\nWith thee awhile: determine on some course,\\nMore than a wild exposture to each chance\\nThat starts i' the way before thee.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nO the gods!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI'll follow thee a month, devise with thee\\nWhere thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us\\nAnd we of thee: so if the time thrust forth\\nA cause for thy repeal, we shall not send\\nO'er the vast world to seek a single man,\\nAnd lose advantage, which doth ever cool\\nI' the absence of the needer.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nFare ye well:\\nThou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full\\nOf the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one\\nThat's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.\\nCome, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and\\nMy friends of noble touch, when I am forth,\\nBid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.\\nWhile I remain above the ground, you shall\\nHear from me still, and never of me aught\\nBut what is like me formerly.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThat's worthily\\nAs any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.\\nIf I could shake off but one seven years\\nFrom these old arms and legs, by the good gods,\\nI'ld with thee every foot.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nGive me thy hand: Come.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nBid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.\\nThe nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided\\nIn his behalf.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nNow we have shown our power,\\nLet us seem humbler after it is done\\nThan when it was a-doing.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nBid them home:\\nSay their great enemy is gone, and they\\nStand in their ancient strength.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nDismiss them home.\\nHere comes his mother.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nLet's not meet her.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWhy?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThey say she's mad.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThey have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nO, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods\\nRequite your love!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPeace, peace; be not so loud.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nIf that I could for weeping, you should hear,--\\nNay, and you shall hear some.\\nWill you be gone?\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nAre you mankind?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nAy, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.\\nWas not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship\\nTo banish him that struck more blows for Rome\\nThan thou hast spoken words?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nO blessed heavens!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nMore noble blows than ever thou wise words;\\nAnd for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:\\nNay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son\\nWere in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,\\nHis good sword in his hand.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhat then?\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nWhat then!\\nHe'ld make an end of thy posterity.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nBastards and all.\\nGood man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nCome, come, peace.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nI would he had continued to his country\\nAs he began, and not unknit himself\\nThe noble knot he made.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nI would he had.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\n'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:\\nCats, that can judge as fitly of his worth\\nAs I can of those mysteries which heaven\\nWill not have earth to know.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nPray, let us go.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nNow, pray, sir, get you gone:\\nYou have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--\\nAs far as doth the Capitol exceed\\nThe meanest house in Rome, so far my son--\\nThis lady's husband here, this, do you see--\\nWhom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWell, well, we'll leave you.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhy stay we to be baited\\nWith one that wants her wits?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nTake my prayers with you.\\nI would the gods had nothing else to do\\nBut to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em\\nBut once a-day, it would unclog my heart\\nOf what lies heavy to't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou have told them home;\\nAnd, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nAnger's my meat; I sup upon myself,\\nAnd so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:\\nLeave this faint puling and lament as I do,\\nIn anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFie, fie, fie!\\n\\nRoman:\\nI know you well, sir, and you know\\nme: your name, I think, is Adrian.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nIt is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.\\n\\nRoman:\\nI am a Roman; and my services are,\\nas you are, against 'em: know you me yet?\\n\\nVolsce:\\nNicanor? no.\\n\\nRoman:\\nThe same, sir.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nYou had more beard when I last saw you; but your\\nfavour is well approved by your tongue. What's the\\nnews in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,\\nto find you out there: you have well saved me a\\nday's journey.\\n\\nRoman:\\nThere hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the\\npeople against the senators, patricians, and nobles.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nHath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not\\nso: they are in a most warlike preparation, and\\nhope to come upon them in the heat of their division.\\n\\nRoman:\\nThe main blaze of it is past, but a small thing\\nwould make it flame again: for the nobles receive\\nso to heart the banishment of that worthy\\nCoriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take\\nall power from the people and to pluck from them\\ntheir tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can\\ntell you, and is almost mature for the violent\\nbreaking out.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nCoriolanus banished!\\n\\nRoman:\\nBanished, sir.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nYou will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.\\n\\nRoman:\\nThe day serves well for them now. I have heard it\\nsaid, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is\\nwhen she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble\\nTullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his\\ngreat opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request\\nof his country.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nHe cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus\\naccidentally to encounter you: you have ended my\\nbusiness, and I will merrily accompany you home.\\n\\nRoman:\\nI shall, between this and supper, tell you most\\nstrange things from Rome; all tending to the good of\\ntheir adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?\\n\\nVolsce:\\nA most royal one; the centurions and their charges,\\ndistinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,\\nand to be on foot at an hour's warning.\\n\\nRoman:\\nI am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the\\nman, I think, that shall set them in present action.\\nSo, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nYou take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause\\nto be glad of yours.\\n\\nRoman:\\nWell, let us go together.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nA goodly city is this Antium. City,\\n'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir\\nOf these fair edifices 'fore my wars\\nHave I heard groan and drop: then know me not,\\nLest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones\\nIn puny battle slay me.\\nSave you, sir.\\n\\nCitizen:\\nAnd you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nDirect me, if it be your will,\\nWhere great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?\\n\\nCitizen:\\nHe is, and feasts the nobles of the state\\nAt his house this night.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhich is his house, beseech you?\\n\\nCitizen:\\nThis, here before you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThank you, sir: farewell.\\nO world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,\\nWhose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,\\nWhose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,\\nAre still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love\\nUnseparable, shall within this hour,\\nOn a dissension of a doit, break out\\nTo bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,\\nWhose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,\\nTo take the one the other, by some chance,\\nSome trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends\\nAnd interjoin their issues. So with me:\\nMy birth-place hate I, and my love's upon\\nThis enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,\\nHe does fair justice; if he give me way,\\nI'll do his country service.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWine, wine, wine! What service\\nis here! I think our fellows are asleep.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nWhere's Cotus? my master calls\\nfor him. Cotus!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nA goodly house: the feast smells well; but I\\nAppear not like a guest.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWhat would you have, friend? whence are you?\\nHere's no place for you: pray, go to the door.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI have deserved no better entertainment,\\nIn being Coriolanus.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nWhence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his\\nhead; that he gives entrance to such companions?\\nPray, get you out.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAway!\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nAway! get you away.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNow thou'rt troublesome.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nAre you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhat fellow's this?\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nA strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him\\nout of the house: prithee, call my master to him.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhat have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid\\nthe house.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nLet me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhat are you?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nA gentleman.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nA marvellous poor one.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTrue, so I am.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nPray you, poor gentleman, take up some other\\nstation; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nFollow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhat, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a\\nstrange guest he has here.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nAnd I shall.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhere dwellest thou?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nUnder the canopy.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nUnder the canopy!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAy.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhere's that?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI' the city of kites and crows.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nI' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!\\nThen thou dwellest with daws too?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo, I serve not thy master.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nHow, sir! do you meddle with my master?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAy; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy\\nmistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy\\ntrencher, hence!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWhere is this fellow?\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nHere, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for\\ndisturbing the lords within.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWhence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?\\nWhy speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nIf, Tullus,\\nNot yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not\\nThink me for the man I am, necessity\\nCommands me name myself.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWhat is thy name?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nA name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,\\nAnd harsh in sound to thine.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nSay, what's thy name?\\nThou hast a grim appearance, and thy face\\nBears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.\\nThou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nPrepare thy brow to frown: know'st\\nthou me yet?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI know thee not: thy name?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMy name is Caius Marcius, who hath done\\nTo thee particularly and to all the Volsces\\nGreat hurt and mischief; thereto witness may\\nMy surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,\\nThe extreme dangers and the drops of blood\\nShed for my thankless country are requited\\nBut with that surname; a good memory,\\nAnd witness of the malice and displeasure\\nWhich thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;\\nThe cruelty and envy of the people,\\nPermitted by our dastard nobles, who\\nHave all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;\\nAnd suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be\\nWhoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity\\nHath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--\\nMistake me not--to save my life, for if\\nI had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world\\nI would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,\\nTo be full quit of those my banishers,\\nStand I before thee here. Then if thou hast\\nA heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge\\nThine own particular wrongs and stop those maims\\nOf shame seen through thy country, speed\\nthee straight,\\nAnd make my misery serve thy turn: so use it\\nThat my revengeful services may prove\\nAs benefits to thee, for I will fight\\nAgainst my canker'd country with the spleen\\nOf all the under fiends. But if so be\\nThou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes\\nThou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am\\nLonger to live most weary, and present\\nMy throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;\\nWhich not to cut would show thee but a fool,\\nSince I have ever follow'd thee with hate,\\nDrawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,\\nAnd cannot live but to thy shame, unless\\nIt be to do thee service.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nO Marcius, Marcius!\\nEach word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart\\nA root of ancient envy. If Jupiter\\nShould from yond cloud speak divine things,\\nAnd say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more\\nThan thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine\\nMine arms about that body, where against\\nMy grained ash an hundred times hath broke\\nAnd scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip\\nThe anvil of my sword, and do contest\\nAs hotly and as nobly with thy love\\nAs ever in ambitious strength I did\\nContend against thy valour. Know thou first,\\nI loved the maid I married; never man\\nSigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,\\nThou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart\\nThan when I first my wedded mistress saw\\nBestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,\\nWe have a power on foot; and I had purpose\\nOnce more to hew thy target from thy brawn,\\nOr lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out\\nTwelve several times, and I have nightly since\\nDreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;\\nWe have been down together in my sleep,\\nUnbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,\\nAnd waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,\\nHad we no quarrel else to Rome, but that\\nThou art thence banish'd, we would muster all\\nFrom twelve to seventy, and pouring war\\nInto the bowels of ungrateful Rome,\\nLike a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,\\nAnd take our friendly senators by the hands;\\nWho now are here, taking their leaves of me,\\nWho am prepared against your territories,\\nThough not for Rome itself.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYou bless me, gods!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nTherefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have\\nThe leading of thine own revenges, take\\nThe one half of my commission; and set down--\\nAs best thou art experienced, since thou know'st\\nThy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;\\nWhether to knock against the gates of Rome,\\nOr rudely visit them in parts remote,\\nTo fright them, ere destroy. But come in:\\nLet me commend thee first to those that shall\\nSay yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!\\nAnd more a friend than e'er an enemy;\\nYet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nHere's a strange alteration!\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nBy my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with\\na cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a\\nfalse report of him.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWhat an arm he has! he turned me about with his\\nfinger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nNay, I knew by his face that there was something in\\nhim: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I\\ncannot tell how to term it.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nHe had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,\\nbut I thought there was more in him than I could think.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nSo did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest\\nman i' the world.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nI think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nWho, my master?\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nNay, it's no matter for that.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nWorth six on him.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nNay, not so neither: but I take him to be the\\ngreater soldier.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nFaith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:\\nfor the defence of a town, our general is excellent.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nAy, and for an assault too.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nO slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWhat, what, what? let's partake.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nI would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as\\nlieve be a condemned man.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWherefore? wherefore?\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhy, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,\\nCaius Marcius.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWhy do you say 'thwack our general '?\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nI do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always\\ngood enough for him.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nCome, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too\\nhard for him; I have heard him say so himself.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nHe was too hard for him directly, to say the troth\\non't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched\\nhim like a carbon ado.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nAn he had been cannibally given, he might have\\nbroiled and eaten him too.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nBut, more of thy news?\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhy, he is so made on here within, as if he were son\\nand heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no\\nquestion asked him by any of the senators, but they\\nstand bald before him: our general himself makes a\\nmistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and\\nturns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But\\nthe bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'\\nthe middle and but one half of what he was\\nyesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty\\nand grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,\\nand sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he\\nwill mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nAnd he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nDo't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as\\nmany friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it\\nwere, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as\\nwe term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nDirectitude! what's that?\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nBut when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,\\nand the man in blood, they will out of their\\nburrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with\\nhim.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nBut when goes this forward?\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nTo-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the\\ndrum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a\\nparcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they\\nwipe their lips.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nWhy, then we shall have a stirring world again.\\nThis peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase\\ntailors, and breed ballad-makers.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nLet me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as\\nday does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and\\nfull of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;\\nmulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more\\nbastard children than war's a destroyer of men.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\n'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to\\nbe a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a\\ngreat maker of cuckolds.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nAy, and it makes men hate one another.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nReason; because they then less need one another.\\nThe wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap\\nas Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.\\n\\nAll:\\nIn, in, in, in!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe hear not of him, neither need we fear him;\\nHis remedies are tame i' the present peace\\nAnd quietness of the people, which before\\nWere in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends\\nBlush that the world goes well, who rather had,\\nThough they themselves did suffer by't, behold\\nDissentious numbers pestering streets than see\\nOur tradesmen with in their shops and going\\nAbout their functions friendly.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWe stood to't in good time.\\nIs this Menenius?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\n'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.\\n\\nBoth Tribunes:\\nHail sir!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHail to you both!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYour Coriolanus\\nIs not much miss'd, but with his friends:\\nThe commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,\\nWere he more angry at it.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAll's well; and might have been much better, if\\nHe could have temporized.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhere is he, hear you?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife\\nHear nothing from him.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nThe gods preserve you both!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nGod-den, our neighbours.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGod-den to you all, god-den to you all.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nOurselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,\\nAre bound to pray for you both.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nLive, and thrive!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nFarewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus\\nHad loved you as we did.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nNow the gods keep you!\\n\\nBoth Tribunes:\\nFarewell, farewell.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis is a happier and more comely time\\nThan when these fellows ran about the streets,\\nCrying confusion.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCaius Marcius was\\nA worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,\\nO'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,\\nSelf-loving,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nAnd affecting one sole throne,\\nWithout assistance.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI think not so.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe should by this, to all our lamentation,\\nIf he had gone forth consul, found it so.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThe gods have well prevented it, and Rome\\nSits safe and still without him.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nWorthy tribunes,\\nThere is a slave, whom we have put in prison,\\nReports, the Volsces with two several powers\\nAre enter'd in the Roman territories,\\nAnd with the deepest malice of the war\\nDestroy what lies before 'em.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\n'Tis Aufidius,\\nWho, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,\\nThrusts forth his horns again into the world;\\nWhich were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,\\nAnd durst not once peep out.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nCome, what talk you\\nOf Marcius?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGo see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be\\nThe Volsces dare break with us.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nCannot be!\\nWe have record that very well it can,\\nAnd three examples of the like have been\\nWithin my age. But reason with the fellow,\\nBefore you punish him, where he heard this,\\nLest you shall chance to whip your information\\nAnd beat the messenger who bids beware\\nOf what is to be dreaded.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nTell not me:\\nI know this cannot be.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nNot possible.\\n\\nMessenger:\\nThe nobles in great earnestness are going\\nAll to the senate-house: some news is come\\nThat turns their countenances.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\n'Tis this slave;--\\nGo whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;\\nNothing but his report.\\n\\nMessenger:\\nYes, worthy sir,\\nThe slave's report is seconded; and more,\\nMore fearful, is deliver'd.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhat more fearful?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nIt is spoke freely out of many mouths--\\nHow probable I do not know--that Marcius,\\nJoin'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,\\nAnd vows revenge as spacious as between\\nThe young'st and oldest thing.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis is most likely!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nRaised only, that the weaker sort may wish\\nGood Marcius home again.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThe very trick on't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThis is unlikely:\\nHe and Aufidius can no more atone\\nThan violentest contrariety.\\n\\nSecond Messenger:\\nYou are sent for to the senate:\\nA fearful army, led by Caius Marcius\\nAssociated with Aufidius, rages\\nUpon our territories; and have already\\nO'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took\\nWhat lay before them.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nO, you have made good work!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat news? what news?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYou have holp to ravish your own daughters and\\nTo melt the city leads upon your pates,\\nTo see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat's the news? what's the news?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYour temples burned in their cement, and\\nYour franchises, whereon you stood, confined\\nInto an auger's bore.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPray now, your news?\\nYou have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--\\nIf Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nIf!\\nHe is their god: he leads them like a thing\\nMade by some other deity than nature,\\nThat shapes man better; and they follow him,\\nAgainst us brats, with no less confidence\\nThan boys pursuing summer butterflies,\\nOr butchers killing flies.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou have made good work,\\nYou and your apron-men; you that stood so up much\\non the voice of occupation and\\nThe breath of garlic-eaters!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHe will shake\\nYour Rome about your ears.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAs Hercules\\nDid shake down mellow fruit.\\nYou have made fair work!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nBut is this true, sir?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nAy; and you'll look pale\\nBefore you find it other. All the regions\\nDo smilingly revolt; and who resist\\nAre mock'd for valiant ignorance,\\nAnd perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?\\nYour enemies and his find something in him.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWe are all undone, unless\\nThe noble man have mercy.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nWho shall ask it?\\nThe tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people\\nDeserve such pity of him as the wolf\\nDoes of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they\\nShould say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even\\nAs those should do that had deserved his hate,\\nAnd therein show'd like enemies.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\n'Tis true:\\nIf he were putting to my house the brand\\nThat should consume it, I have not the face\\nTo say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,\\nYou and your crafts! you have crafted fair!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYou have brought\\nA trembling upon Rome, such as was never\\nSo incapable of help.\\n\\nBoth Tribunes:\\nSay not we brought it.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHow! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts\\nAnd cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,\\nWho did hoot him out o' the city.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nBut I fear\\nThey'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,\\nThe second name of men, obeys his points\\nAs if he were his officer: desperation\\nIs all the policy, strength and defence,\\nThat Rome can make against them.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHere come the clusters.\\nAnd is Aufidius with him? You are they\\nThat made the air unwholesome, when you cast\\nYour stinking greasy caps in hooting at\\nCoriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;\\nAnd not a hair upon a soldier's head\\nWhich will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs\\nAs you threw caps up will he tumble down,\\nAnd pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;\\nif he could burn us all into one coal,\\nWe have deserved it.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nFaith, we hear fearful news.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nFor mine own part,\\nWhen I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nAnd so did I.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nAnd so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very\\nmany of us: that we did, we did for the best; and\\nthough we willingly consented to his banishment, yet\\nit was against our will.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYe re goodly things, you voices!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou have made\\nGood work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nO, ay, what else?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nGo, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:\\nThese are a side that would be glad to have\\nThis true which they so seem to fear. Go home,\\nAnd show no sign of fear.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nThe gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.\\nI ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished\\nhim.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nSo did we all. But, come, let's home.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nI do not like this news.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNor I.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLet's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth\\nWould buy this for a lie!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nPray, let us go.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nDo they still fly to the Roman?\\n\\nLieutenant:\\nI do not know what witchcraft's in him, but\\nYour soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,\\nTheir talk at table, and their thanks at end;\\nAnd you are darken'd in this action, sir,\\nEven by your own.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI cannot help it now,\\nUnless, by using means, I lame the foot\\nOf our design. He bears himself more proudlier,\\nEven to my person, than I thought he would\\nWhen first I did embrace him: yet his nature\\nIn that's no changeling; and I must excuse\\nWhat cannot be amended.\\n\\nLieutenant:\\nYet I wish, sir,--\\nI mean for your particular,--you had not\\nJoin'd in commission with him; but either\\nHad borne the action of yourself, or else\\nTo him had left it solely.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI understand thee well; and be thou sure,\\nwhen he shall come to his account, he knows not\\nWhat I can urge against him. Although it seems,\\nAnd so he thinks, and is no less apparent\\nTo the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.\\nAnd shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,\\nFights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon\\nAs draw his sword; yet he hath left undone\\nThat which shall break his neck or hazard mine,\\nWhene'er we come to our account.\\n\\nLieutenant:\\nSir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nAll places yield to him ere he sits down;\\nAnd the nobility of Rome are his:\\nThe senators and patricians love him too:\\nThe tribunes are no soldiers; and their people\\nWill be as rash in the repeal, as hasty\\nTo expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome\\nAs is the osprey to the fish, who takes it\\nBy sovereignty of nature. First he was\\nA noble servant to them; but he could not\\nCarry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,\\nWhich out of daily fortune ever taints\\nThe happy man; whether defect of judgment,\\nTo fail in the disposing of those chances\\nWhich he was lord of; or whether nature,\\nNot to be other than one thing, not moving\\nFrom the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace\\nEven with the same austerity and garb\\nAs he controll'd the war; but one of these--\\nAs he hath spices of them all, not all,\\nFor I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,\\nSo hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,\\nTo choke it in the utterance. So our virtues\\nLie in the interpretation of the time:\\nAnd power, unto itself most commendable,\\nHath not a tomb so evident as a chair\\nTo extol what it hath done.\\nOne fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;\\nRights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.\\nCome, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,\\nThou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNo, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said\\nWhich was sometime his general; who loved him\\nIn a most dear particular. He call'd me father:\\nBut what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;\\nA mile before his tent fall down, and knee\\nThe way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd\\nTo hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHe would not seem to know me.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nDo you hear?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYet one time he did call me by my name:\\nI urged our old acquaintance, and the drops\\nThat we have bled together. Coriolanus\\nHe would not answer to: forbad all names;\\nHe was a kind of nothing, titleless,\\nTill he had forged himself a name o' the fire\\nOf burning Rome.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhy, so: you have made good work!\\nA pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,\\nTo make coals cheap,--a noble memory!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI minded him how royal 'twas to pardon\\nWhen it was less expected: he replied,\\nIt was a bare petition of a state\\nTo one whom they had punish'd.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nVery well:\\nCould he say less?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI offer'd to awaken his regard\\nFor's private friends: his answer to me was,\\nHe could not stay to pick them in a pile\\nOf noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,\\nFor one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,\\nAnd still to nose the offence.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFor one poor grain or two!\\nI am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,\\nAnd this brave fellow too, we are the grains:\\nYou are the musty chaff; and you are smelt\\nAbove the moon: we must be burnt for you.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid\\nIn this so never-needed help, yet do not\\nUpbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you\\nWould be your country's pleader, your good tongue,\\nMore than the instant army we can make,\\nMight stop our countryman.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNo, I'll not meddle.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nPray you, go to him.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat should I do?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nOnly make trial what your love can do\\nFor Rome, towards Marcius.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWell, and say that Marcius\\nReturn me, as Cominius is return'd,\\nUnheard; what then?\\nBut as a discontented friend, grief-shot\\nWith his unkindness? say't be so?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYet your good will\\nmust have that thanks from Rome, after the measure\\nAs you intended well.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI'll undertake 't:\\nI think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip\\nAnd hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.\\nHe was not taken well; he had not dined:\\nThe veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then\\nWe pout upon the morning, are unapt\\nTo give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd\\nThese and these conveyances of our blood\\nWith wine and feeding, we have suppler souls\\nThan in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him\\nTill he be dieted to my request,\\nAnd then I'll set upon him.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nYou know the very road into his kindness,\\nAnd cannot lose your way.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nGood faith, I'll prove him,\\nSpeed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge\\nOf my success.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHe'll never hear him.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNot?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye\\nRed as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury\\nThe gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;\\n'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me\\nThus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,\\nHe sent in writing after me; what he would not,\\nBound with an oath to yield to his conditions:\\nSo that all hope is vain.\\nUnless his noble mother, and his wife;\\nWho, as I hear, mean to solicit him\\nFor mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,\\nAnd with our fair entreaties haste them on.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nStay: whence are you?\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nStand, and go back.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,\\nI am an officer of state, and come\\nTo speak with Coriolanus.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nFrom whence?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFrom Rome.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nYou may not pass, you must return: our general\\nWill no more hear from thence.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nYou'll see your Rome embraced with fire before\\nYou'll speak with Coriolanus.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nGood my friends,\\nIf you have heard your general talk of Rome,\\nAnd of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,\\nMy name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nBe it so; go back: the virtue of your name\\nIs not here passable.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI tell thee, fellow,\\nThe general is my lover: I have been\\nThe book of his good acts, whence men have read\\nHis name unparallel'd, haply amplified;\\nFor I have ever verified my friends,\\nOf whom he's chief, with all the size that verity\\nWould without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,\\nLike to a bowl upon a subtle ground,\\nI have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise\\nHave almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,\\nI must have leave to pass.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nFaith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his\\nbehalf as you have uttered words in your own, you\\nshould not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous\\nto lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPrithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,\\nalways factionary on the party of your general.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nHowsoever you have been his liar, as you say you\\nhave, I am one that, telling true under him, must\\nsay, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHas he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not\\nspeak with him till after dinner.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nYou are a Roman, are you?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI am, as thy general is.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nThen you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,\\nwhen you have pushed out your gates the very\\ndefender of them, and, in a violent popular\\nignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to\\nfront his revenges with the easy groans of old\\nwomen, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with\\nthe palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as\\nyou seem to be? Can you think to blow out the\\nintended fire your city is ready to flame in, with\\nsuch weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;\\ntherefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your\\nexecution: you are condemned, our general has sworn\\nyou out of reprieve and pardon.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would\\nuse me with estimation.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nCome, my captain knows you not.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI mean, thy general.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nMy general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest\\nI let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's\\nthe utmost of your having: back.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNay, but, fellow, fellow,--\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat's the matter?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNow, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:\\nYou shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall\\nperceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from\\nmy son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment\\nwith him, if thou standest not i' the state of\\nhanging, or of some death more long in\\nspectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now\\npresently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.\\nThe glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy\\nparticular prosperity, and love thee no worse than\\nthy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!\\nthou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's\\nwater to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to\\nthee; but being assured none but myself could move\\nthee, I have been blown out of your gates with\\nsighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy\\npetitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy\\nwrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet\\nhere,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my\\naccess to thee.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAway!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHow! away!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs\\nAre servanted to others: though I owe\\nMy revenge properly, my remission lies\\nIn Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,\\nIngrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather\\nThan pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.\\nMine ears against your suits are stronger than\\nYour gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,\\nTake this along; I writ it for thy sake\\nAnd would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,\\nI will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,\\nWas my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nYou keep a constant temper.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nNow, sir, is your name Menenius?\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\n'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the\\nway home again.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nDo you hear how we are shent for keeping your\\ngreatness back?\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nWhat cause, do you think, I have to swoon?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI neither care for the world nor your general: for\\nsuch things as you, I can scarce think there's any,\\nye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by\\nhimself fears it not from another: let your general\\ndo his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and\\nyour misery increase with your age! I say to you,\\nas I was said to, Away!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nA noble fellow, I warrant him.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nThe worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the\\noak not to be wind-shaken.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWe will before the walls of Rome tomorrow\\nSet down our host. My partner in this action,\\nYou must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly\\nI have borne this business.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nOnly their ends\\nYou have respected; stopp'd your ears against\\nThe general suit of Rome; never admitted\\nA private whisper, no, not with such friends\\nThat thought them sure of you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThis last old man,\\nWhom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,\\nLoved me above the measure of a father;\\nNay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge\\nWas to send him; for whose old love I have,\\nThough I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd\\nThe first conditions, which they did refuse\\nAnd cannot now accept; to grace him only\\nThat thought he could do more, a very little\\nI have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,\\nNor from the state nor private friends, hereafter\\nWill I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?\\nShall I be tempted to infringe my vow\\nIn the same time 'tis made? I will not.\\nMy wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould\\nWherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand\\nThe grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!\\nAll bond and privilege of nature, break!\\nLet it be virtuous to be obstinate.\\nWhat is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,\\nWhich can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not\\nOf stronger earth than others. My mother bows;\\nAs if Olympus to a molehill should\\nIn supplication nod: and my young boy\\nHath an aspect of intercession, which\\nGreat nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces\\nPlough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never\\nBe such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,\\nAs if a man were author of himself\\nAnd knew no other kin.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nMy lord and husband!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThese eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nThe sorrow that delivers us thus changed\\nMakes you think so.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nLike a dull actor now,\\nI have forgot my part, and I am out,\\nEven to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,\\nForgive my tyranny; but do not say\\nFor that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss\\nLong as my exile, sweet as my revenge!\\nNow, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss\\nI carried from thee, dear; and my true lip\\nHath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,\\nAnd the most noble mother of the world\\nLeave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;\\nOf thy deep duty more impression show\\nThan that of common sons.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nO, stand up blest!\\nWhilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,\\nI kneel before thee; and unproperly\\nShow duty, as mistaken all this while\\nBetween the child and parent.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat is this?\\nYour knees to me? to your corrected son?\\nThen let the pebbles on the hungry beach\\nFillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds\\nStrike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;\\nMurdering impossibility, to make\\nWhat cannot be, slight work.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nThou art my warrior;\\nI holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThe noble sister of Publicola,\\nThe moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle\\nThat's curdied by the frost from purest snow\\nAnd hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nThis is a poor epitome of yours,\\nWhich by the interpretation of full time\\nMay show like all yourself.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThe god of soldiers,\\nWith the consent of supreme Jove, inform\\nThy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove\\nTo shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars\\nLike a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,\\nAnd saving those that eye thee!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nYour knee, sirrah.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThat's my brave boy!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nEven he, your wife, this lady, and myself,\\nAre suitors to you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI beseech you, peace:\\nOr, if you'ld ask, remember this before:\\nThe thing I have forsworn to grant may never\\nBe held by you denials. Do not bid me\\nDismiss my soldiers, or capitulate\\nAgain with Rome's mechanics: tell me not\\nWherein I seem unnatural: desire not\\nTo ally my rages and revenges with\\nYour colder reasons.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nO, no more, no more!\\nYou have said you will not grant us any thing;\\nFor we have nothing else to ask, but that\\nWhich you deny already: yet we will ask;\\nThat, if you fail in our request, the blame\\nMay hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll\\nHear nought from Rome in private. Your request?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nShould we be silent and not speak, our raiment\\nAnd state of bodies would bewray what life\\nWe have led since thy exile. Think with thyself\\nHow more unfortunate than all living women\\nAre we come hither: since that thy sight,\\nwhich should\\nMake our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance\\nwith comforts,\\nConstrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;\\nMaking the mother, wife and child to see\\nThe son, the husband and the father tearing\\nHis country's bowels out. And to poor we\\nThine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us\\nOur prayers to the gods, which is a comfort\\nThat all but we enjoy; for how can we,\\nAlas, how can we for our country pray.\\nWhereto we are bound, together with thy victory,\\nWhereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose\\nThe country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,\\nOur comfort in the country. We must find\\nAn evident calamity, though we had\\nOur wish, which side should win: for either thou\\nMust, as a foreign recreant, be led\\nWith manacles thorough our streets, or else\\ntriumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,\\nAnd bear the palm for having bravely shed\\nThy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,\\nI purpose not to wait on fortune till\\nThese wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee\\nRather to show a noble grace to both parts\\nThan seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner\\nMarch to assault thy country than to tread--\\nTrust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,\\nThat brought thee to this world.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nAy, and mine,\\nThat brought you forth this boy, to keep your name\\nLiving to time.\\n\\nYoung MARCIUS:\\nA' shall not tread on me;\\nI'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNot of a woman's tenderness to be,\\nRequires nor child nor woman's face to see.\\nI have sat too long.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nNay, go not from us thus.\\nIf it were so that our request did tend\\nTo save the Romans, thereby to destroy\\nThe Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,\\nAs poisonous of your honour: no; our suit\\nIs that you reconcile them: while the Volsces\\nMay say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,\\n'This we received;' and each in either side\\nGive the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest\\nFor making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,\\nThe end of war's uncertain, but this certain,\\nThat, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit\\nWhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,\\nWhose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;\\nWhose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,\\nBut with his last attempt he wiped it out;\\nDestroy'd his country, and his name remains\\nTo the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:\\nThou hast affected the fine strains of honour,\\nTo imitate the graces of the gods;\\nTo tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,\\nAnd yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt\\nThat should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?\\nThink'st thou it honourable for a noble man\\nStill to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:\\nHe cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:\\nPerhaps thy childishness will move him more\\nThan can our reasons. There's no man in the world\\nMore bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate\\nLike one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life\\nShow'd thy dear mother any courtesy,\\nWhen she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,\\nHas cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,\\nLoaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,\\nAnd spurn me back: but if it be not so,\\nThou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,\\nThat thou restrain'st from me the duty which\\nTo a mother's part belongs. He turns away:\\nDown, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.\\nTo his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride\\nThan pity to our prayers. Down: an end;\\nThis is the last: so we will home to Rome,\\nAnd die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:\\nThis boy, that cannot tell what he would have\\nBut kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,\\nDoes reason our petition with more strength\\nThan thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:\\nThis fellow had a Volscian to his mother;\\nHis wife is in Corioli and his child\\nLike him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:\\nI am hush'd until our city be a-fire,\\nAnd then I'll speak a little.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nO mother, mother!\\nWhat have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,\\nThe gods look down, and this unnatural scene\\nThey laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!\\nYou have won a happy victory to Rome;\\nBut, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,\\nMost dangerously you have with him prevail'd,\\nIf not most mortal to him. But, let it come.\\nAufidius, though I cannot make true wars,\\nI'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,\\nWere you in my stead, would you have heard\\nA mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI was moved withal.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI dare be sworn you were:\\nAnd, sir, it is no little thing to make\\nMine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,\\nWhat peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,\\nI'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,\\nStand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAy, by and by;\\nBut we will drink together; and you shall bear\\nA better witness back than words, which we,\\nOn like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.\\nCome, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve\\nTo have a temple built you: all the swords\\nIn Italy, and her confederate arms,\\nCould not have made this peace.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSee you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond\\ncorner-stone?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhy, what of that?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nIf it be possible for you to displace it with your\\nlittle finger, there is some hope the ladies of\\nRome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.\\nBut I say there is no hope in't: our throats are\\nsentenced and stay upon execution.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nIs't possible that so short a time can alter the\\ncondition of a man!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThere is differency between a grub and a butterfly;\\nyet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown\\nfrom man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a\\ncreeping thing.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHe loved his mother dearly.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSo did he me: and he no more remembers his mother\\nnow than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness\\nof his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he\\nmoves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before\\nhis treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with\\nhis eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a\\nbattery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for\\nAlexander. What he bids be done is finished with\\nhis bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity\\nand a heaven to throne in.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYes, mercy, if you report him truly.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his\\nmother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy\\nin him than there is milk in a male tiger; that\\nshall our poor city find: and all this is long of\\nyou.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThe gods be good unto us!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNo, in such a case the gods will not be good unto\\nus. When we banished him, we respected not them;\\nand, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.\\n\\nMessenger:\\nSir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:\\nThe plebeians have got your fellow-tribune\\nAnd hale him up and down, all swearing, if\\nThe Roman ladies bring not comfort home,\\nThey'll give him death by inches.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhat's the news?\\n\\nSecond Messenger:\\nGood news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,\\nThe Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:\\nA merrier day did never yet greet Rome,\\nNo, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nFriend,\\nArt thou certain this is true? is it most certain?\\n\\nSecond Messenger:\\nAs certain as I know the sun is fire:\\nWhere have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?\\nNe'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,\\nAs the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!\\nThe trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,\\nTabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,\\nMake the sun dance. Hark you!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThis is good news:\\nI will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia\\nIs worth of consuls, senators, patricians,\\nA city full; of tribunes, such as you,\\nA sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:\\nThis morning for ten thousand of your throats\\nI'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nFirst, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,\\nAccept my thankfulness.\\n\\nSecond Messenger:\\nSir, we have all\\nGreat cause to give great thanks.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThey are near the city?\\n\\nSecond Messenger:\\nAlmost at point to enter.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe will meet them,\\nAnd help the joy.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nBehold our patroness, the life of Rome!\\nCall all your tribes together, praise the gods,\\nAnd make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:\\nUnshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,\\nRepeal him with the welcome of his mother;\\nCry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'\\n\\nAll:\\nWelcome, ladies, Welcome!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nGo tell the lords o' the city I am here:\\nDeliver them this paper: having read it,\\nBid them repair to the market place; where I,\\nEven in theirs and in the commons' ears,\\nWill vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse\\nThe city ports by this hath enter'd and\\nIntends to appear before the people, hoping\\nTo purge herself with words: dispatch.\\nMost welcome!\\n\\nFirst Conspirator:\\nHow is it with our general?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nEven so\\nAs with a man by his own alms empoison'd,\\nAnd with his charity slain.\\n\\nSecond Conspirator:\\nMost noble sir,\\nIf you do hold the same intent wherein\\nYou wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you\\nOf your great danger.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nSir, I cannot tell:\\nWe must proceed as we do find the people.\\n\\nThird Conspirator:\\nThe people will remain uncertain whilst\\n'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either\\nMakes the survivor heir of all.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI know it;\\nAnd my pretext to strike at him admits\\nA good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd\\nMine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,\\nHe water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,\\nSeducing so my friends; and, to this end,\\nHe bow'd his nature, never known before\\nBut to be rough, unswayable and free.\\n\\nThird Conspirator:\\nSir, his stoutness\\nWhen he did stand for consul, which he lost\\nBy lack of stooping,--\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nThat I would have spoke of:\\nBeing banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;\\nPresented to my knife his throat: I took him;\\nMade him joint-servant with me; gave him way\\nIn all his own desires; nay, let him choose\\nOut of my files, his projects to accomplish,\\nMy best and freshest men; served his designments\\nIn mine own person; holp to reap the fame\\nWhich he did end all his; and took some pride\\nTo do myself this wrong: till, at the last,\\nI seem'd his follower, not partner, and\\nHe waged me with his countenance, as if\\nI had been mercenary.\\n\\nFirst Conspirator:\\nSo he did, my lord:\\nThe army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,\\nWhen he had carried Rome and that we look'd\\nFor no less spoil than glory,--\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nThere was it:\\nFor which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.\\nAt a few drops of women's rheum, which are\\nAs cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour\\nOf our great action: therefore shall he die,\\nAnd I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!\\n\\nFirst Conspirator:\\nYour native town you enter'd like a post,\\nAnd had no welcomes home: but he returns,\\nSplitting the air with noise.\\n\\nSecond Conspirator:\\nAnd patient fools,\\nWhose children he hath slain, their base throats tear\\nWith giving him glory.\\n\\nThird Conspirator:\\nTherefore, at your vantage,\\nEre he express himself, or move the people\\nWith what he would say, let him feel your sword,\\nWhich we will second. When he lies along,\\nAfter your way his tale pronounced shall bury\\nHis reasons with his body.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nSay no more:\\nHere come the lords.\\n\\nAll The Lords:\\nYou are most welcome home.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI have not deserved it.\\nBut, worthy lords, have you with heed perused\\nWhat I have written to you?\\n\\nLords:\\nWe have.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nAnd grieve to hear't.\\nWhat faults he made before the last, I think\\nMight have found easy fines: but there to end\\nWhere he was to begin and give away\\nThe benefit of our levies, answering us\\nWith our own charge, making a treaty where\\nThere was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nHe approaches: you shall hear him.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,\\nNo more infected with my country's love\\nThan when I parted hence, but still subsisting\\nUnder your great command. You are to know\\nThat prosperously I have attempted and\\nWith bloody passage led your wars even to\\nThe gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home\\nDo more than counterpoise a full third part\\nThe charges of the action. We have made peace\\nWith no less honour to the Antiates\\nThan shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,\\nSubscribed by the consuls and patricians,\\nTogether with the seal o' the senate, what\\nWe have compounded on.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nRead it not, noble lords;\\nBut tell the traitor, in the high'st degree\\nHe hath abused your powers.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTraitor! how now!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nAy, traitor, Marcius!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMarcius!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nAy, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think\\nI'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name\\nCoriolanus in Corioli?\\nYou lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously\\nHe has betray'd your business, and given up,\\nFor certain drops of salt, your city Rome,\\nI say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;\\nBreaking his oath and resolution like\\nA twist of rotten silk, never admitting\\nCounsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears\\nHe whined and roar'd away your victory,\\nThat pages blush'd at him and men of heart\\nLook'd wondering each at other.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHear'st thou, Mars?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nName not the god, thou boy of tears!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHa!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nNo more.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMeasureless liar, thou hast made my heart\\nToo great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!\\nPardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever\\nI was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,\\nMust give this cur the lie: and his own notion--\\nWho wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that\\nMust bear my beating to his grave--shall join\\nTo thrust the lie unto him.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nPeace, both, and hear me speak.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nCut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,\\nStain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!\\nIf you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,\\nThat, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I\\nFlutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:\\nAlone I did it. Boy!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWhy, noble lords,\\nWill you be put in mind of his blind fortune,\\nWhich was your shame, by this unholy braggart,\\n'Fore your own eyes and ears?\\n\\nAll Conspirators:\\nLet him die for't.\\n\\nAll The People:\\n'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd\\nmy son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin\\nMarcus.' 'He killed my father.'\\n\\nSecond Lord:\\nPeace, ho! no outrage: peace!\\nThe man is noble and his fame folds-in\\nThis orb o' the earth. His last offences to us\\nShall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,\\nAnd trouble not the peace.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nO that I had him,\\nWith six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,\\nTo use my lawful sword!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nInsolent villain!\\n\\nAll Conspirators:\\nKill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!\\n\\nLords:\\nHold, hold, hold, hold!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nMy noble masters, hear me speak.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nO Tullus,--\\n\\nSecond Lord:\\nThou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.\\n\\nThird Lord:\\nTread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;\\nPut up your swords.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nMy lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,\\nProvoked by him, you cannot--the great danger\\nWhich this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice\\nThat he is thus cut off. Please it your honours\\nTo call me to your senate, I'll deliver\\nMyself your loyal servant, or endure\\nYour heaviest censure.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBear from hence his body;\\nAnd mourn you for him: let him be regarded\\nAs the most noble corse that ever herald\\nDid follow to his urn.\\n\\nSecond Lord:\\nHis own impatience\\nTakes from Aufidius a great part of blame.\\nLet's make the best of it.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nMy rage is gone;\\nAnd I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.\\nHelp, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.\\nBeat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:\\nTrail your steel pikes. Though in this city he\\nHath widow'd and unchilded many a one,\\nWhich to this hour bewail the injury,\\nYet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.\\n\\nGLOUCESTER:\\nNow is the winter of our discontent\\nMade glorious summer by this sun of York;\\nAnd all the clouds that lour'd upon our house\\nIn the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\\nNow are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\\nOur bruised arms hung up for monuments;\\nOur stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\\nOur dreadful marches to delightful measures.\\nGrim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;\\nAnd now, instead of mounting barded steeds\\nTo fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\\nHe capers nimbly in a lady's chamber\\nTo the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\\nBut I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\\nNor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\\nI, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty\\nTo strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\\nI, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,\\nCheated of feature by dissembling nature,\\nDeformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time\\nInto this breathing world, scarce half made up,\\nAnd that so lamely and unfashionable\\nThat dogs bark at me as I halt by them;\\nWhy, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\\nHave no delight to pass away the time,\\nUnless to spy my shadow in the sun\\nAnd descant on mine own deformity:\\nAnd therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,\\nTo entertain these fair well-spoken days,\\nI am determined to prove a villain\\nAnd hate the idle pleasures of these days.\\nPlots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\\nBy drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,\\nTo set my brother Clarence and the king\\nIn deadly hate the one against the other:\\nAnd if King Edward be as true and just\\nAs I am subtle, false and treacherous,\\nThis day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,\\nAbout a prophecy, which says that 'G'\\nOf Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.\\nDive, thoughts, down to my soul: here\\nClarence comes.\\nBrother, good day; what means this armed guard\\nThat waits upon your grace?\\n\\nCLARENCE:\\nHis majesty\\nTendering my person's safety, hath appointed\\nThis conduct to convey me to the Tower.\\n\\nGLOUCESTER:\\nUpon what cause?\\n\\nCLARENCE:\\nBecause my name is George.\\n\\nGLOUCESTER:\\nAlack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;\\nHe should, for that, commit your godfathers:\\nO, belike his majesty hath some intent\\nThat you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.\\nBut what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?\\n\\nCLARENCE:\\nYea, Richard, when I know; for I protest\\nAs yet I do not: but, as I can learn,\\nHe hearkens after prophecies and dreams;\\nAnd from the cross-row plucks the letter G.\\nAnd says a wizard told him that by G\\nHis issue disinherited should be;\\nAnd, for my name of George begins with G,\\nIt follows in his thought that I am he.\\nThese, as I learn, and such like toys as these\\nHave moved his highness to commit me now.\\n\\nGLOUCESTER:\\nWhy, this it is, when men are ruled by women:\\n'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:\\nMy Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she\\nThat tempers him to this extremity.\\nWas it not she and that good man of worship,\\nAnthony Woodville, her brother there,\\nThat made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,\\nFrom whence this present day he is deliver'd?\\nWe are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.\\n\\nCLARENCE:\\nBy heaven, I think there's no man is secure\\nBut the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds\\nThat trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.\\nHeard ye not what an humble suppliant\\nLord hastings was to her for his delivery?\\n\\nGLOUCESTER:\\nHumbly complaining to her deity\\nGot my lord chamberlain his liberty.\\nI'll tell you what; I think it is our way,\\nIf we will keep in favour with the king,\\nTo be her men and wear her livery:\\nThe jealous o'erworn widow and herself,\\nSince that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.\\nAre mighty gossips in this monarchy.\\n\\nBRAKENBURY:\\nI beseech your graces both to pardon me;\\nHis majesty hath straitly given in charge\\nThat no man shall have private conference,\\nOf what degree soever, with his brother.\\n\\nGLOUCESTER:\\nEven so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,\\nYou may partake of any thing we say:\\nWe speak no treason, man: we say the king\\nIs wise and virtuous, and his noble queen\\nWell struck in years, fair, and not jealous;\\nWe say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,\\nA cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;\\nAnd that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:\\nHow say you sir?

How say you?\\nMy prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'\\nOne of them you shall be.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nYour guest, then, madam:\\nTo be your prisoner should import offending;\\nWhich is for me less easy to commit\\nThan you to punish.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNot your gaoler, then,\\nBut your kind hostess.

Had we pursued that life,\\nAnd our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd\\nWith stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven\\nBoldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd\\nHereditary ours.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nBy this we gather\\nYou have tripp'd since.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nO my most sacred lady!\\nTemptations have since then been born to's; for\\nIn those unfledged days was my wife a girl;\\nYour precious self had then not cross'd the eyes\\nOf my young play-fellow.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nGrace to boot!\\nOf this make no conclusion, lest you say\\nYour queen and I are devils: yet go on;\\nThe offences we have made you do we'll answer,\\nIf you first sinn'd with us and that with us\\nYou did continue fault and that you slipp'd not\\nWith any but with us.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIs he won yet?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nHe'll stay my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAt my request he would not.\\nHermione, my dearest, thou never spokest\\nTo better purpose.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNever?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNever, but once.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWhat! have I twice said well? when was't before?\\nI prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's\\nAs fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless\\nSlaughters a thousand waiting upon that.\\nOur praises are our wages: you may ride's\\nWith one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere\\nWith spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:\\nMy last good deed was to entreat his stay:\\nWhat was my first? it has an elder sister,\\nOr I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!\\nBut once before I spoke to the purpose: when?\\nNay, let me have't; I long.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy, that was when\\nThree crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,\\nEre I could make thee open thy white hand\\nAnd clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter\\n'I am yours for ever.'\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\n'Tis grace indeed.\\nWhy, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:\\nThe one for ever earn'd a royal husband;\\nThe other for some while a friend.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nAy, my good lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI' fecks!\\nWhy, that's my bawcock. What, hast\\nsmutch'd thy nose?\\nThey say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,\\nWe must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:\\nAnd yet the steer, the heifer and the calf\\nAre all call'd neat.--Still virginalling\\nUpon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!\\nArt thou my calf?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nYes, if you will, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,\\nTo be full like me: yet they say we are\\nAlmost as like as eggs; women say so,\\nThat will say anything but were they false\\nAs o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false\\nAs dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes\\nNo bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true\\nTo say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,\\nLook on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!\\nMost dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--\\nAffection! thy intention stabs the centre:\\nThou dost make possible things not so held,\\nCommunicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--\\nWith what's unreal thou coactive art,\\nAnd fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent\\nThou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,\\nAnd that beyond commission, and I find it,\\nAnd that to the infection of my brains\\nAnd hardening of my brows.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWhat means Sicilia?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nHe something seems unsettled.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow, my lord!\\nWhat cheer? how is't with you, best brother?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nYou look as if you held a brow of much distraction\\nAre you moved, my lord?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo, in good earnest.\\nHow sometimes nature will betray its folly,\\nIts tenderness, and make itself a pastime\\nTo harder bosoms! Looking on the lines\\nOf my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil\\nTwenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,\\nIn my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,\\nLest it should bite its master, and so prove,\\nAs ornaments oft do, too dangerous:\\nHow like, methought, I then was to this kernel,\\nThis squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,\\nWill you take eggs for money?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNo, my lord, I'll fight.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,\\nAre you so fond of your young prince as we\\nDo seem to be of ours?\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nIf at home, sir,\\nHe's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,\\nNow my sworn friend and then mine enemy,\\nMy parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:\\nHe makes a July's day short as December,\\nAnd with his varying childness cures in me\\nThoughts that would thick my blood.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nSo stands this squire\\nOfficed with me: we two will walk, my lord,\\nAnd leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,\\nHow thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;\\nLet what is dear in Sicily be cheap:\\nNext to thyself and my young rover, he's\\nApparent to my heart.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nIf you would seek us,\\nWe are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTo your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,\\nBe you beneath the sky.\\nI am angling now,\\nThough you perceive me not how I give line.\\nGo to, go to!\\nHow she holds up the neb, the bill to him!\\nAnd arms her with the boldness of a wife\\nTo her allowing husband!\\nGone already!\\nInch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and\\nears a fork'd one!\\nGo, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I\\nPlay too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue\\nWill hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour\\nWill be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.\\nThere have been,\\nOr I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;\\nAnd many a man there is, even at this present,\\nNow while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,\\nThat little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence\\nAnd his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by\\nSir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't\\nWhiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,\\nAs mine, against their will. Should all despair\\nThat have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind\\nWould hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;\\nIt is a bawdy planet, that will strike\\nWhere 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,\\nFrom east, west, north and south: be it concluded,\\nNo barricado for a belly; know't;\\nIt will let in and out the enemy\\nWith bag and baggage: many thousand on's\\nHave the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nI am like you, they say.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nAy, my good lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.\\nCamillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nYou had much ado to make his anchor hold:\\nWhen you cast out, it still came home.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nDidst note it?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe would not stay at your petitions: made\\nHis business more material.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nDidst perceive it?\\nThey're here with me already, whispering, rounding\\n'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,\\nWhen I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,\\nThat he did stay?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nAt the good queen's entreaty.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAt the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent\\nBut, so it is, it is not. Was this taken\\nBy any understanding pate but thine?\\nFor thy conceit is soaking, will draw in\\nMore than the common blocks: not noted, is't,\\nBut of the finer natures? by some severals\\nOf head-piece extraordinary? lower messes\\nPerchance are to this business purblind? say.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBusiness, my lord! I think most understand\\nBohemia stays here longer.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHa!\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nStays here longer.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAy, but why?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nTo satisfy your highness and the entreaties\\nOf our most gracious mistress.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nSatisfy!\\nThe entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!\\nLet that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,\\nWith all the nearest things to my heart, as well\\nMy chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou\\nHast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed\\nThy penitent reform'd: but we have been\\nDeceived in thy integrity, deceived\\nIn that which seems so.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBe it forbid, my lord!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTo bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,\\nIf thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,\\nWhich hoxes honesty behind, restraining\\nFrom course required; or else thou must be counted\\nA servant grafted in my serious trust\\nAnd therein negligent; or else a fool\\nThat seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,\\nAnd takest it all for jest.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nMy gracious lord,\\nI may be negligent, foolish and fearful;\\nIn every one of these no man is free,\\nBut that his negligence, his folly, fear,\\nAmong the infinite doings of the world,\\nSometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\\nIf ever I were wilful-negligent,\\nIt was my folly; if industriously\\nI play'd the fool, it was my negligence,\\nNot weighing well the end; if ever fearful\\nTo do a thing, where I the issue doubted,\\nWhere of the execution did cry out\\nAgainst the non-performance, 'twas a fear\\nWhich oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,\\nAre such allow'd infirmities that honesty\\nIs never free of. But, beseech your grace,\\nBe plainer with me; let me know my trespass\\nBy its own visage: if I then deny it,\\n'Tis none of mine.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHa' not you seen, Camillo,--\\nBut that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass\\nIs thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--\\nFor to a vision so apparent rumour\\nCannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation\\nResides not in that man that does not think,--\\nMy wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,\\nOr else be impudently negative,\\nTo have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say\\nMy wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name\\nAs rank as any flax-wench that puts to\\nBefore her troth-plight: say't and justify't.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI would not be a stander-by to hear\\nMy sovereign mistress clouded so, without\\nMy present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,\\nYou never spoke what did become you less\\nThan this; which to reiterate were sin\\nAs deep as that, though true.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIs whispering nothing?\\nIs leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?\\nKissing with inside lip? stopping the career\\nOf laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible\\nOf breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?\\nSkulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?\\nHours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes\\nBlind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,\\nThat would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?\\nWhy, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;\\nThe covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;\\nMy wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,\\nIf this be nothing.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nGood my lord, be cured\\nOf this diseased opinion, and betimes;\\nFor 'tis most dangerous.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nSay it be, 'tis true.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNo, no, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIt is; you lie, you lie:\\nI say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,\\nPronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,\\nOr else a hovering temporizer, that\\nCanst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,\\nInclining to them both: were my wife's liver\\nInfected as her life, she would not live\\nThe running of one glass.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWho does infect her?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy, he that wears her like a medal, hanging\\nAbout his neck, Bohemia: who, if I\\nHad servants true about me, that bare eyes\\nTo see alike mine honour as their profits,\\nTheir own particular thrifts, they would do that\\nWhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,\\nHis cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form\\nHave benched and reared to worship, who mayst see\\nPlainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\\nHow I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,\\nTo give mine enemy a lasting wink;\\nWhich draught to me were cordial.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, my lord,\\nI could do this, and that with no rash potion,\\nBut with a lingering dram that should not work\\nMaliciously like poison: but I cannot\\nBelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,\\nSo sovereignly being honourable.\\nI have loved thee,--\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nMake that thy question, and go rot!\\nDost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,\\nTo appoint myself in this vexation, sully\\nThe purity and whiteness of my sheets,\\nWhich to preserve is sleep, which being spotted\\nIs goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,\\nGive scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,\\nWho I do think is mine and love as mine,\\nWithout ripe moving to't? Would I do this?\\nCould man so blench?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI must believe you, sir:\\nI do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;\\nProvided that, when he's removed, your highness\\nWill take again your queen as yours at first,\\nEven for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing\\nThe injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\\nKnown and allied to yours.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou dost advise me\\nEven so as I mine own course have set down:\\nI'll give no blemish to her honour, none.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nMy lord,\\nGo then; and with a countenance as clear\\nAs friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\\nAnd with your queen. I am his cupbearer:\\nIf from me he have wholesome beverage,\\nAccount me not your servant.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThis is all:\\nDo't and thou hast the one half of my heart;\\nDo't not, thou split'st thine own.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI'll do't, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nO miserable lady! But, for me,\\nWhat case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\\nOf good Polixenes; and my ground to do't\\nIs the obedience to a master, one\\nWho in rebellion with himself will have\\nAll that are his so too. To do this deed,\\nPromotion follows. If I could find example\\nOf thousands that had struck anointed kings\\nAnd flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since\\nNor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,\\nLet villany itself forswear't. I must\\nForsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain\\nTo me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!\\nHere comes Bohemia.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThis is strange: methinks\\nMy favour here begins to warp. Not speak?\\nGood day, Camillo.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHail, most royal sir!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWhat is the news i' the court?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNone rare, my lord.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThe king hath on him such a countenance\\nAs he had lost some province and a region\\nLoved as he loves himself: even now I met him\\nWith customary compliment; when he,\\nWafting his eyes to the contrary and falling\\nA lip of much contempt, speeds from me and\\nSo leaves me to consider what is breeding\\nThat changeth thus his manners.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI dare not know, my lord.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?\\nBe intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;\\nFor, to yourself, what you do know, you must.\\nAnd cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,\\nYour changed complexions are to me a mirror\\nWhich shows me mine changed too; for I must be\\nA party in this alteration, finding\\nMyself thus alter'd with 't.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThere is a sickness\\nWhich puts some of us in distemper, but\\nI cannot name the disease; and it is caught\\nOf you that yet are well.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow! caught of me!\\nMake me not sighted like the basilisk:\\nI have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better\\nBy my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--\\nAs you are certainly a gentleman, thereto\\nClerk-like experienced, which no less adorns\\nOur gentry than our parents' noble names,\\nIn whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,\\nIf you know aught which does behove my knowledge\\nThereof to be inform'd, imprison't not\\nIn ignorant concealment.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI may not answer.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nA sickness caught of me, and yet I well!\\nI must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,\\nI conjure thee, by all the parts of man\\nWhich honour does acknowledge, whereof the least\\nIs not this suit of mine, that thou declare\\nWhat incidency thou dost guess of harm\\nIs creeping toward me; how far off, how near;\\nWhich way to be prevented, if to be;\\nIf not, how best to bear it.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, I will tell you;\\nSince I am charged in honour and by him\\nThat I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,\\nWhich must be even as swiftly follow'd as\\nI mean to utter it, or both yourself and me\\nCry lost, and so good night!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nOn, good Camillo.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI am appointed him to murder you.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nBy whom, Camillo?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBy the king.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nFor what?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,\\nAs he had seen't or been an instrument\\nTo vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen\\nForbiddenly.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nO, then my best blood turn\\nTo an infected jelly and my name\\nBe yoked with his that did betray the Best!\\nTurn then my freshest reputation to\\nA savour that may strike the dullest nostril\\nWhere I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,\\nNay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection\\nThat e'er was heard or read!\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSwear his thought over\\nBy each particular star in heaven and\\nBy all their influences, you may as well\\nForbid the sea for to obey the moon\\nAs or by oath remove or counsel shake\\nThe fabric of his folly, whose foundation\\nIs piled upon his faith and will continue\\nThe standing of his body.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow should this grow?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to\\nAvoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.\\nIf therefore you dare trust my honesty,\\nThat lies enclosed in this trunk which you\\nShall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!\\nYour followers I will whisper to the business,\\nAnd will by twos and threes at several posterns\\nClear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put\\nMy fortunes to your service, which are here\\nBy this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;\\nFor, by the honour of my parents, I\\nHave utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,\\nI dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer\\nThan one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon\\nHis execution sworn.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI do believe thee:\\nI saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:\\nBe pilot to me and thy places shall\\nStill neighbour mine. My ships are ready and\\nMy people did expect my hence departure\\nTwo days ago. This jealousy\\nIs for a precious creature: as she's rare,\\nMust it be great, and as his person's mighty,\\nMust it be violent, and as he does conceive\\nHe is dishonour'd by a man which ever\\nProfess'd to him, why, his revenges must\\nIn that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:\\nGood expedition be my friend, and comfort\\nThe gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing\\nOf his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;\\nI will respect thee as a father if\\nThou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nIt is in mine authority to command\\nThe keys of all the posterns: please your highness\\nTo take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nTake the boy to you: he so troubles me,\\n'Tis past enduring.\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nCome, my gracious lord,\\nShall I be your playfellow?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNo, I'll none of you.\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nWhy, my sweet lord?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nYou'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if\\nI were a baby still. I love you better.\\n\\nSecond Lady:\\nAnd why so, my lord?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNot for because\\nYour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,\\nBecome some women best, so that there be not\\nToo much hair there, but in a semicircle\\nOr a half-moon made with a pen.\\n\\nSecond Lady:\\nWho taught you this?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nI learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now\\nWhat colour are your eyebrows?\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nBlue, my lord.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose\\nThat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nHark ye;\\nThe queen your mother rounds apace: we shall\\nPresent our services to a fine new prince\\nOne of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,\\nIf we would have you.\\n\\nSecond Lady:\\nShe is spread of late\\nInto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWhat wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now\\nI am for you again: pray you, sit by us,\\nAnd tell 's a tale.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nMerry or sad shall't be?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nAs merry as you will.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nA sad tale's best for winter: I have one\\nOf sprites and goblins.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nLet's have that, good sir.\\nCome on, sit down: come on, and do your best\\nTo fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nThere was a man--\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNay, come, sit down; then on.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nDwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;\\nYond crickets shall not hear it.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nCome on, then,\\nAnd give't me in mine ear.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWas he met there? his train? Camillo with him?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBehind the tuft of pines I met them; never\\nSaw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them\\nEven to their ships.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow blest am I\\nIn my just censure, in my true opinion!\\nAlack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed\\nIn being so blest! There may be in the cup\\nA spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,\\nAnd yet partake no venom, for his knowledge\\nIs not infected: but if one present\\nThe abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known\\nHow he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,\\nWith violent hefts. I have drunk,\\nand seen the spider.\\nCamillo was his help in this, his pander:\\nThere is a plot against my life, my crown;\\nAll's true that is mistrusted: that false villain\\nWhom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:\\nHe has discover'd my design, and I\\nRemain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick\\nFor them to play at will. How came the posterns\\nSo easily open?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBy his great authority;\\nWhich often hath no less prevail'd than so\\nOn your command.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI know't too well.\\nGive me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:\\nThough he does bear some signs of me, yet you\\nHave too much blood in him.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWhat is this? sport?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nBear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;\\nAway with him! and let her sport herself\\nWith that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes\\nHas made thee swell thus.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nBut I'ld say he had not,\\nAnd I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,\\nHowe'er you lean to the nayward.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou, my lords,\\nLook on her, mark her well; be but about\\nTo say 'she is a goodly lady,' and\\nThe justice of your bearts will thereto add\\n'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'\\nPraise her but for this her without-door form,\\nWhich on my faith deserves high speech, and straight\\nThe shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands\\nThat calumny doth use--O, I am out--\\nThat mercy does, for calumny will sear\\nVirtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,\\nWhen you have said 'she's goodly,' come between\\nEre you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,\\nFrom him that has most cause to grieve it should be,\\nShe's an adulteress.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nShould a villain say so,\\nThe most replenish'd villain in the world,\\nHe were as much more villain: you, my lord,\\nDo but mistake.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou have mistook, my lady,\\nPolixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!\\nWhich I'll not call a creature of thy place,\\nLest barbarism, making me the precedent,\\nShould a like language use to all degrees\\nAnd mannerly distinguishment leave out\\nBetwixt the prince and beggar: I have said\\nShe's an adulteress; I have said with whom:\\nMore, she's a traitor and Camillo is\\nA federary with her, and one that knows\\nWhat she should shame to know herself\\nBut with her most vile principal, that she's\\nA bed-swerver, even as bad as those\\nThat vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy\\nTo this their late escape.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNo, by my life.\\nPrivy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\\nWhen you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\\nYou thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,\\nYou scarce can right me throughly then to say\\nYou did mistake.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo; if I mistake\\nIn those foundations which I build upon,\\nThe centre is not big enough to bear\\nA school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!\\nHe who shall speak for her is afar off guilty\\nBut that he speaks.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nThere's some ill planet reigns:\\nI must be patient till the heavens look\\nWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\\nI am not prone to weeping, as our sex\\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\\nPerchance shall dry your pities: but I have\\nThat honourable grief lodged here which burns\\nWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\\nWith thoughts so qualified as your charities\\nShall best instruct you, measure me; and so\\nThe king's will be perform'd!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nShall I be heard?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWho is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,\\nMy women may be with me; for you see\\nMy plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;\\nThere is no cause: when you shall know your mistress\\nHas deserved prison, then abound in tears\\nAs I come out: this action I now go on\\nIs for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:\\nI never wish'd to see you sorry; now\\nI trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo, do our bidding; hence!\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBeseech your highness, call the queen again.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nBe certain what you do, sir, lest your justice\\nProve violence; in the which three great ones suffer,\\nYourself, your queen, your son.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nFor her, my lord,\\nI dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,\\nPlease you to accept it, that the queen is spotless\\nI' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,\\nIn this which you accuse her.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nIf it prove\\nShe's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where\\nI lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;\\nThan when I feel and see her no farther trust her;\\nFor every inch of woman in the world,\\nAy, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHold your peaces.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nGood my lord,--\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nIt is for you we speak, not for ourselves:\\nYou are abused and by some putter-on\\nThat will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,\\nI would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,\\nI have three daughters; the eldest is eleven\\nThe second and the third, nine, and some five;\\nIf this prove true, they'll pay for't:\\nby mine honour,\\nI'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,\\nTo bring false generations: they are co-heirs;\\nAnd I had rather glib myself than they\\nShould not produce fair issue.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nCease; no more.\\nYou smell this business with a sense as cold\\nAs is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't\\nAs you feel doing thus; and see withal\\nThe instruments that feel.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nIf it be so,\\nWe need no grave to bury honesty:\\nThere's not a grain of it the face to sweeten\\nOf the whole dungy earth.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat! lack I credit?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nI had rather you did lack than I, my lord,\\nUpon this ground; and more it would content me\\nTo have her honour true than your suspicion,\\nBe blamed for't how you might.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy, what need we\\nCommune with you of this, but rather follow\\nOur forceful instigation? Our prerogative\\nCalls not your counsels, but our natural goodness\\nImparts this; which if you, or stupefied\\nOr seeming so in skill, cannot or will not\\nRelish a truth like us, inform yourselves\\nWe need no more of your advice: the matter,\\nThe loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all\\nProperly ours.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nAnd I wish, my liege,\\nYou had only in your silent judgment tried it,\\nWithout more overture.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow could that be?\\nEither thou art most ignorant by age,\\nOr thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,\\nAdded to their familiarity,\\nWhich was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,\\nThat lack'd sight only, nought for approbation\\nBut only seeing, all other circumstances\\nMade up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:\\nYet, for a greater confirmation,\\nFor in an act of this importance 'twere\\nMost piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post\\nTo sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,\\nCleomenes and Dion, whom you know\\nOf stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle\\nThey will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,\\nShall stop or spur me. Have I done well?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nWell done, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThough I am satisfied and need no more\\nThan what I know, yet shall the oracle\\nGive rest to the minds of others, such as he\\nWhose ignorant credulity will not\\nCome up to the truth. So have we thought it good\\nFrom our free person she should be confined,\\nLest that the treachery of the two fled hence\\nBe left her to perform. Come, follow us;\\nWe are to speak in public; for this business\\nWill raise us all.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThe keeper of the prison, call to him;\\nlet him have knowledge who I am.\\nGood lady,\\nNo court in Europe is too good for thee;\\nWhat dost thou then in prison?\\nNow, good sir,\\nYou know me, do you not?\\n\\nGaoler:\\nFor a worthy lady\\nAnd one whom much I honour.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nPray you then,\\nConduct me to the queen.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nI may not, madam:\\nTo the contrary I have express commandment.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nHere's ado,\\nTo lock up honesty and honour from\\nThe access of gentle visitors!\\nIs't lawful, pray you,\\nTo see her women? any of them? Emilia?\\n\\nGaoler:\\nSo please you, madam,\\nTo put apart these your attendants, I\\nShall bring Emilia forth.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI pray now, call her.\\nWithdraw yourselves.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nAnd, madam,\\nI must be present at your conference.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWell, be't so, prithee.\\nHere's such ado to make no stain a stain\\nAs passes colouring.\\nDear gentlewoman,\\nHow fares our gracious lady?\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nAs well as one so great and so forlorn\\nMay hold together: on her frights and griefs,\\nWhich never tender lady hath born greater,\\nShe is something before her time deliver'd.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nA boy?\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nA daughter, and a goodly babe,\\nLusty and like to live: the queen receives\\nMuch comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,\\nI am innocent as you.'\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI dare be sworn\\nThese dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,\\nbeshrew them!\\nHe must be told on't, and he shall: the office\\nBecomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:\\nIf I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister\\nAnd never to my red-look'd anger be\\nThe trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,\\nCommend my best obedience to the queen:\\nIf she dares trust me with her little babe,\\nI'll show't the king and undertake to be\\nHer advocate to the loud'st. We do not know\\nHow he may soften at the sight o' the child:\\nThe silence often of pure innocence\\nPersuades when speaking fails.\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nMost worthy madam,\\nYour honour and your goodness is so evident\\nThat your free undertaking cannot miss\\nA thriving issue: there is no lady living\\nSo meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship\\nTo visit the next room, I'll presently\\nAcquaint the queen of your most noble offer;\\nWho but to-day hammer'd of this design,\\nBut durst not tempt a minister of honour,\\nLest she should be denied.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nTell her, Emilia.\\nI'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't\\nAs boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted\\nI shall do good.\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nNow be you blest for it!\\nI'll to the queen: please you,\\ncome something nearer.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nMadam, if't please the queen to send the babe,\\nI know not what I shall incur to pass it,\\nHaving no warrant.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nYou need not fear it, sir:\\nThis child was prisoner to the womb and is\\nBy law and process of great nature thence\\nFreed and enfranchised, not a party to\\nThe anger of the king nor guilty of,\\nIf any be, the trespass of the queen.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nI do believe it.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nDo not you fear: upon mine honour,\\nI will stand betwixt you and danger.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness\\nTo bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If\\nThe cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,\\nShe the adulteress; for the harlot king\\nIs quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank\\nAnd level of my brain, plot-proof; but she\\nI can hook to me: say that she were gone,\\nGiven to the fire, a moiety of my rest\\nMight come to me again. Who's there?\\n\\nFirst Servant:\\nMy lord?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow does the boy?\\n\\nFirst Servant:\\nHe took good rest to-night;\\n'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTo see his nobleness!\\nConceiving the dishonour of his mother,\\nHe straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,\\nFasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,\\nThrew off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,\\nAnd downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,\\nSee how he fares.\\nFie, fie! no thought of him:\\nThe thought of my revenges that way\\nRecoil upon me: in himself too mighty,\\nAnd in his parties, his alliance; let him be\\nUntil a time may serve: for present vengeance,\\nTake it on her. Camillo and Polixenes\\nLaugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:\\nThey should not laugh if I could reach them, nor\\nShall she within my power.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nYou must not enter.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:\\nFear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,\\nThan the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,\\nMore free than he is jealous.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nThat's enough.\\n\\nSecond Servant:\\nMadam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded\\nNone should come at him.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNot so hot, good sir:\\nI come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,\\nThat creep like shadows by him and do sigh\\nAt each his needless heavings, such as you\\nNourish the cause of his awaking: I\\nDo come with words as medicinal as true,\\nHonest as either, to purge him of that humour\\nThat presses him from sleep.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat noise there, ho?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNo noise, my lord; but needful conference\\nAbout some gossips for your highness.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow!\\nAway with that audacious lady! Antigonus,\\nI charged thee that she should not come about me:\\nI knew she would.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI told her so, my lord,\\nOn your displeasure's peril and on mine,\\nShe should not visit you.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat, canst not rule her?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nFrom all dishonesty he can: in this,\\nUnless he take the course that you have done,\\nCommit me for committing honour, trust it,\\nHe shall not rule me.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nLa you now, you hear:\\nWhen she will take the rein I let her run;\\nBut she'll not stumble.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nGood my liege, I come;\\nAnd, I beseech you, hear me, who profess\\nMyself your loyal servant, your physician,\\nYour most obedient counsellor, yet that dare\\nLess appear so in comforting your evils,\\nThan such as most seem yours: I say, I come\\nFrom your good queen.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGood queen!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nGood queen, my lord,\\nGood queen; I say good queen;\\nAnd would by combat make her good, so were I\\nA man, the worst about you.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nForce her hence.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nLet him that makes but trifles of his eyes\\nFirst hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;\\nBut first I'll do my errand. The good queen,\\nFor she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;\\nHere 'tis; commends it to your blessing.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nOut!\\nA mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:\\nA most intelligencing bawd!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNot so:\\nI am as ignorant in that as you\\nIn so entitling me, and no less honest\\nThan you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,\\nAs this world goes, to pass for honest.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTraitors!\\nWill you not push her out? Give her the bastard.\\nThou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted\\nBy thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;\\nTake't up, I say; give't to thy crone.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nFor ever\\nUnvenerable be thy hands, if thou\\nTakest up the princess by that forced baseness\\nWhich he has put upon't!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHe dreads his wife.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nSo I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt\\nYou'ld call your children yours.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nA nest of traitors!\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI am none, by this good light.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNor I, nor any\\nBut one that's here, and that's himself, for he\\nThe sacred honour of himself, his queen's,\\nHis hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,\\nWhose sting is sharper than the sword's;\\nand will not--\\nFor, as the case now stands, it is a curse\\nHe cannot be compell'd to't--once remove\\nThe root of his opinion, which is rotten\\nAs ever oak or stone was sound.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nA callat\\nOf boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband\\nAnd now baits me! This brat is none of mine;\\nIt is the issue of Polixenes:\\nHence with it, and together with the dam\\nCommit them to the fire!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nIt is yours;\\nAnd, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,\\nSo like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,\\nAlthough the print be little, the whole matter\\nAnd copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,\\nThe trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,\\nThe pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,\\nHis smiles,\\nThe very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:\\nAnd thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it\\nSo like to him that got it, if thou hast\\nThe ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours\\nNo yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,\\nHer children not her husband's!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nA gross hag\\nAnd, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,\\nThat wilt not stay her tongue.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nHang all the husbands\\nThat cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself\\nHardly one subject.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nOnce more, take her hence.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nA most unworthy and unnatural lord\\nCan do no more.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI'll ha' thee burnt.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI care not:\\nIt is an heretic that makes the fire,\\nNot she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;\\nBut this most cruel usage of your queen,\\nNot able to produce more accusation\\nThan your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours\\nOf tyranny and will ignoble make you,\\nYea, scandalous to the world.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nOn your allegiance,\\nOut of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,\\nWhere were her life? she durst not call me so,\\nIf she did know me one. Away with her!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.\\nLook to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:\\nJove send her\\nA better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?\\nYou, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,\\nWill never do him good, not one of you.\\nSo, so: farewell; we are gone.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.\\nMy child? away with't! Even thou, that hast\\nA heart so tender o'er it, take it hence\\nAnd see it instantly consumed with fire;\\nEven thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:\\nWithin this hour bring me word 'tis done,\\nAnd by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,\\nWith what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse\\nAnd wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;\\nThe bastard brains with these my proper hands\\nShall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;\\nFor thou set'st on thy wife.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI did not, sir:\\nThese lords, my noble fellows, if they please,\\nCan clear me in't.\\n\\nLords:\\nWe can: my royal liege,\\nHe is not guilty of her coming hither.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou're liars all.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBeseech your highness, give us better credit:\\nWe have always truly served you, and beseech you\\nSo to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,\\nAs recompense of our dear services\\nPast and to come, that you do change this purpose,\\nWhich being so horrible, so bloody, must\\nLead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI am a feather for each wind that blows:\\nShall I live on to see this bastard kneel\\nAnd call me father? better burn it now\\nThan curse it then. But be it; let it live.\\nIt shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;\\nYou that have been so tenderly officious\\nWith Lady Margery, your midwife there,\\nTo save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,\\nSo sure as this beard's grey,\\n--what will you adventure\\nTo save this brat's life?\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nAny thing, my lord,\\nThat my ability may undergo\\nAnd nobleness impose: at least thus much:\\nI'll pawn the little blood which I have left\\nTo save the innocent: any thing possible.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIt shall be possible. Swear by this sword\\nThou wilt perform my bidding.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI will, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nMark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail\\nOf any point in't shall not only be\\nDeath to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,\\nWhom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,\\nAs thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry\\nThis female bastard hence and that thou bear it\\nTo some remote and desert place quite out\\nOf our dominions, and that there thou leave it,\\nWithout more mercy, to its own protection\\nAnd favour of the climate. As by strange fortune\\nIt came to us, I do in justice charge thee,\\nOn thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,\\nThat thou commend it strangely to some place\\nWhere chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI swear to do this, though a present death\\nHad been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:\\nSome powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens\\nTo be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say\\nCasting their savageness aside have done\\nLike offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous\\nIn more than this deed does require! And blessing\\nAgainst this cruelty fight on thy side,\\nPoor thing, condemn'd to loss!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo, I'll not rear\\nAnother's issue.\\n\\nServant:\\nPlease your highness, posts\\nFrom those you sent to the oracle are come\\nAn hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,\\nBeing well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,\\nHasting to the court.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nSo please you, sir, their speed\\nHath been beyond account.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTwenty-three days\\nThey have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells\\nThe great Apollo suddenly will have\\nThe truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;\\nSummon a session, that we may arraign\\nOur most disloyal lady, for, as she hath\\nBeen publicly accused, so shall she have\\nA just and open trial. While she lives\\nMy heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,\\nAnd think upon my bidding.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nThe climate's delicate, the air most sweet,\\nFertile the isle, the temple much surpassing\\nThe common praise it bears.\\n\\nDION:\\nI shall report,\\nFor most it caught me, the celestial habits,\\nMethinks I so should term them, and the reverence\\nOf the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!\\nHow ceremonious, solemn and unearthly\\nIt was i' the offering!\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nBut of all, the burst\\nAnd the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,\\nKin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.\\nThat I was nothing.\\n\\nDION:\\nIf the event o' the journey\\nProve as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--\\nAs it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,\\nThe time is worth the use on't.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nGreat Apollo\\nTurn all to the best! These proclamations,\\nSo forcing faults upon Hermione,\\nI little like.\\n\\nDION:\\nThe violent carriage of it\\nWill clear or end the business: when the oracle,\\nThus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,\\nShall the contents discover, something rare\\nEven then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!\\nAnd gracious be the issue!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThis sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,\\nEven pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried\\nThe daughter of a king, our wife, and one\\nOf us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd\\nOf being tyrannous, since we so openly\\nProceed in justice, which shall have due course,\\nEven to the guilt or the purgation.\\nProduce the prisoner.\\n\\nOfficer:\\nIt is his highness' pleasure that the queen\\nAppear in person here in court. Silence!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nRead the indictment.\\n\\nOfficer:\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nSince what I am to say must be but that\\nWhich contradicts my accusation and\\nThe testimony on my part no other\\nBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\\nTo say 'not guilty:' mine integrity\\nBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,\\nBe so received. But thus: if powers divine\\nBehold our human actions, as they do,\\nI doubt not then but innocence shall make\\nFalse accusation blush and tyranny\\nTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,\\nWho least will seem to do so, my past life\\nHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\\nAs I am now unhappy; which is more\\nThan history can pattern, though devised\\nAnd play'd to take spectators. For behold me\\nA fellow of the royal bed, which owe\\nA moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,\\nThe mother to a hopeful prince, here standing\\nTo prate and talk for life and honour 'fore\\nWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\\nAs I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,\\n'Tis a derivative from me to mine,\\nAnd only that I stand for. I appeal\\nTo your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\\nCame to your court, how I was in your grace,\\nHow merited to be so; since he came,\\nWith what encounter so uncurrent I\\nHave strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond\\nThe bound of honour, or in act or will\\nThat way inclining, harden'd be the hearts\\nOf all that hear me, and my near'st of kin\\nCry fie upon my grave!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI ne'er heard yet\\nThat any of these bolder vices wanted\\nLess impudence to gainsay what they did\\nThan to perform it first.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nThat's true enough;\\nThrough 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou will not own it.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nMore than mistress of\\nWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must not\\nAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\\nWith whom I am accused, I do confess\\nI loved him as in honour he required,\\nWith such a kind of love as might become\\nA lady like me, with a love even such,\\nSo and no other, as yourself commanded:\\nWhich not to have done I think had been in me\\nBoth disobedience and ingratitude\\nTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,\\nEven since it could speak, from an infant, freely\\nThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,\\nI know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd\\nFor me to try how: all I know of it\\nIs that Camillo was an honest man;\\nAnd why he left your court, the gods themselves,\\nWotting no more than I, are ignorant.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou knew of his departure, as you know\\nWhat you have underta'en to do in's absence.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nSir,\\nYou speak a language that I understand not:\\nMy life stands in the level of your dreams,\\nWhich I'll lay down.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYour actions are my dreams;\\nYou had a bastard by Polixenes,\\nAnd I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--\\nThose of your fact are so--so past all truth:\\nWhich to deny concerns more than avails; for as\\nThy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,\\nNo father owning it,--which is, indeed,\\nMore criminal in thee than it,--so thou\\nShalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage\\nLook for no less than death.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nSir, spare your threats:\\nThe bug which you would fright me with I seek.\\nTo me can life be no commodity:\\nThe crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\\nI do give lost; for I do feel it gone,\\nBut know not how it went. My second joy\\nAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presence\\nI am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort\\nStarr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,\\nThe innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,\\nHaled out to murder: myself on every post\\nProclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred\\nThe child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs\\nTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\\nHere to this place, i' the open air, before\\nI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\\nTell me what blessings I have here alive,\\nThat I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.\\nBut yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,\\nI prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,\\nWhich I would free, if I shall be condemn'd\\nUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\\nBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you\\n'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,\\nI do refer me to the oracle:\\nApollo be my judge!\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nThis your request\\nIs altogether just: therefore bring forth,\\nAnd in Apollos name, his oracle.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nThe Emperor of Russia was my father:\\nO that he were alive, and here beholding\\nHis daughter's trial! that he did but see\\nThe flatness of my misery, yet with eyes\\nOf pity, not revenge!\\n\\nOfficer:\\nYou here shall swear upon this sword of justice,\\nThat you, Cleomenes and Dion, have\\nBeen both at Delphos, and from thence have brought\\nThe seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd\\nOf great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,\\nYou have not dared to break the holy seal\\nNor read the secrets in't.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nAll this we swear.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nBreak up the seals and read.\\n\\nOfficer:\\n\\nLords:\\nNow blessed be the great Apollo!\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nPraised!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHast thou read truth?\\n\\nOfficer:\\nAy, my lord; even so\\nAs it is here set down.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThere is no truth at all i' the oracle:\\nThe sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.\\n\\nServant:\\nMy lord the king, the king!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat is the business?\\n\\nServant:\\nO sir, I shall be hated to report it!\\nThe prince your son, with mere conceit and fear\\nOf the queen's speed, is gone.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow! gone!\\n\\nServant:\\nIs dead.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nApollo's angry; and the heavens themselves\\nDo strike at my injustice.\\nHow now there!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThis news is mortal to the queen: look down\\nAnd see what death is doing.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTake her hence:\\nHer heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:\\nI have too much believed mine own suspicion:\\nBeseech you, tenderly apply to her\\nSome remedies for life.\\nApollo, pardon\\nMy great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!\\nI'll reconcile me to Polixenes,\\nNew woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,\\nWhom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;\\nFor, being transported by my jealousies\\nTo bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose\\nCamillo for the minister to poison\\nMy friend Polixenes: which had been done,\\nBut that the good mind of Camillo tardied\\nMy swift command, though I with death and with\\nReward did threaten and encourage him,\\nNot doing 't and being done: he, most humane\\nAnd fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest\\nUnclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,\\nWhich you knew great, and to the hazard\\nOf all encertainties himself commended,\\nNo richer than his honour: how he glisters\\nThorough my rust! and how his pity\\nDoes my deeds make the blacker!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWoe the while!\\nO, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,\\nBreak too.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nWhat fit is this, good lady?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWhat studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?\\nWhat wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?\\nIn leads or oils? what old or newer torture\\nMust I receive, whose every word deserves\\nTo taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny\\nTogether working with thy jealousies,\\nFancies too weak for boys, too green and idle\\nFor girls of nine, O, think what they have done\\nAnd then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all\\nThy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.\\nThat thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;\\nThat did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant\\nAnd damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,\\nThou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,\\nTo have him kill a king: poor trespasses,\\nMore monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon\\nThe casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter\\nTo be or none or little; though a devil\\nWould have shed water out of fire ere done't:\\nNor is't directly laid to thee, the death\\nOf the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,\\nThoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart\\nThat could conceive a gross and foolish sire\\nBlemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,\\nLaid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,\\nWhen I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,\\nThe sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,\\nand vengeance for't\\nNot dropp'd down yet.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nThe higher powers forbid!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath\\nPrevail not, go and see: if you can bring\\nTincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,\\nHeat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you\\nAs I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!\\nDo not repent these things, for they are heavier\\nThan all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee\\nTo nothing but despair. A thousand knees\\nTen thousand years together, naked, fasting,\\nUpon a barren mountain and still winter\\nIn storm perpetual, could not move the gods\\nTo look that way thou wert.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo on, go on\\nThou canst not speak too much; I have deserved\\nAll tongues to talk their bitterest.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nSay no more:\\nHowe'er the business goes, you have made fault\\nI' the boldness of your speech.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI am sorry for't:\\nAll faults I make, when I shall come to know them,\\nI do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much\\nThe rashness of a woman: he is touch'd\\nTo the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help\\nShould be past grief: do not receive affliction\\nAt my petition; I beseech you, rather\\nLet me be punish'd, that have minded you\\nOf what you should forget. Now, good my liege\\nSir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:\\nThe love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--\\nI'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;\\nI'll not remember you of my own lord,\\nWho is lost too: take your patience to you,\\nAnd I'll say nothing.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou didst speak but well\\nWhen most the truth; which I receive much better\\nThan to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me\\nTo the dead bodies of my queen and son:\\nOne grave shall be for both: upon them shall\\nThe causes of their death appear, unto\\nOur shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit\\nThe chapel where they lie, and tears shed there\\nShall be my recreation: so long as nature\\nWill bear up with this exercise, so long\\nI daily vow to use it. Come and lead me\\nUnto these sorrows.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nThou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon\\nThe deserts of Bohemia?\\n\\nMariner:\\nAy, my lord: and fear\\nWe have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly\\nAnd threaten present blusters. In my conscience,\\nThe heavens with that we have in hand are angry\\nAnd frown upon 's.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nTheir sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;\\nLook to thy bark: I'll not be long before\\nI call upon thee.\\n\\nMariner:\\nMake your best haste, and go not\\nToo far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;\\nBesides, this place is famous for the creatures\\nOf prey that keep upon't.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nGo thou away:\\nI'll follow instantly.\\n\\nMariner:\\nI am glad at heart\\nTo be so rid o' the business.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nCome, poor babe:\\nI have heard, but not believed,\\nthe spirits o' the dead\\nMay walk again: if such thing be, thy mother\\nAppear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream\\nSo like a waking. To me comes a creature,\\nSometimes her head on one side, some another;\\nI never saw a vessel of like sorrow,\\nSo fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,\\nLike very sanctity, she did approach\\nMy cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,\\nAnd gasping to begin some speech, her eyes\\nBecame two spouts: the fury spent, anon\\nDid this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,\\nSince fate, against thy better disposition,\\nHath made thy person for the thrower-out\\nOf my poor babe, according to thine oath,\\nPlaces remote enough are in Bohemia,\\nThere weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe\\nIs counted lost for ever, Perdita,\\nI prithee, call't. For this ungentle business\\nPut on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see\\nThy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks\\nShe melted into air. Affrighted much,\\nI did in time collect myself and thought\\nThis was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:\\nYet for this once, yea, superstitiously,\\nI will be squared by this. I do believe\\nHermione hath suffer'd death, and that\\nApollo would, this being indeed the issue\\nOf King Polixenes, it should here be laid,\\nEither for life or death, upon the earth\\nOf its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!\\nThere lie, and there thy character: there these;\\nWhich may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,\\nAnd still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,\\nThat for thy mother's fault art thus exposed\\nTo loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,\\nBut my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I\\nTo be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!\\nThe day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have\\nA lullaby too rough: I never saw\\nThe heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!\\nWell may I get aboard! This is the chase:\\nI am gone for ever.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nI would there were no age between sixteen and\\nthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the\\nrest; for there is nothing in the between but\\ngetting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,\\nstealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but\\nthese boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty\\nhunt this weather? They have scared away two of my\\nbest sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find\\nthan the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by\\nthe seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy\\nwill what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very\\npretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A\\npretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:\\nthough I am not bookish, yet I can read\\nwaiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been\\nsome stair-work, some trunk-work, some\\nbehind-door-work: they were warmer that got this\\nthan the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for\\npity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed\\nbut even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!\\n\\nClown:\\nHilloa, loa!\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWhat, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk\\non when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What\\nailest thou, man?\\n\\nClown:\\nI have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!\\nbut I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the\\nsky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust\\na bodkin's point.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWhy, boy, how is it?\\n\\nClown:\\nI would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,\\nhow it takes up the shore! but that's not the\\npoint. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!\\nsometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the\\nship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon\\nswallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a\\ncork into a hogshead. And then for the\\nland-service, to see how the bear tore out his\\nshoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said\\nhis name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an\\nend of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned\\nit: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the\\nsea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared\\nand the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than\\nthe sea or weather.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nName of mercy, when was this, boy?\\n\\nClown:\\nNow, now: I have not winked since I saw these\\nsights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor\\nthe bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it\\nnow.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWould I had been by, to have helped the old man!\\n\\nClown:\\nI would you had been by the ship side, to have\\nhelped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nHeavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,\\nboy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things\\ndying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for\\nthee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's\\nchild! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;\\nopen't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be\\nrich by the fairies. This is some changeling:\\nopen't. What's within, boy?\\n\\nClown:\\nYou're a made old man: if the sins of your youth\\nare forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!\\n\\nShepherd:\\nThis is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up\\nwith't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.\\nWe are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires\\nnothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good\\nboy, the next way home.\\n\\nClown:\\nGo you the next way with your findings. I'll go see\\nif the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much\\nhe hath eaten: they are never curst but when they\\nare hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury\\nit.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nThat's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that\\nwhich is left of him what he is, fetch me to the\\nsight of him.\\n\\nClown:\\nMarry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.\\n\\nShepherd:\\n'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.\\n\\nTime:\\nI, that please some, try all, both joy and terror\\nOf good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,\\nNow take upon me, in the name of Time,\\nTo use my wings. Impute it not a crime\\nTo me or my swift passage, that I slide\\nO'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried\\nOf that wide gap, since it is in my power\\nTo o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour\\nTo plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass\\nThe same I am, ere ancient'st order was\\nOr what is now received: I witness to\\nThe times that brought them in; so shall I do\\nTo the freshest things now reigning and make stale\\nThe glistering of this present, as my tale\\nNow seems to it. Your patience this allowing,\\nI turn my glass and give my scene such growing\\nAs you had slept between: Leontes leaving,\\nThe effects of his fond jealousies so grieving\\nThat he shuts up himself, imagine me,\\nGentle spectators, that I now may be\\nIn fair Bohemia, and remember well,\\nI mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel\\nI now name to you; and with speed so pace\\nTo speak of Perdita, now grown in grace\\nEqual with wondering: what of her ensues\\nI list not prophecy; but let Time's news\\nBe known when 'tis brought forth.\\nA shepherd's daughter,\\nAnd what to her adheres, which follows after,\\nIs the argument of Time. Of this allow,\\nIf ever you have spent time worse ere now;\\nIf never, yet that Time himself doth say\\nHe wishes earnestly you never may.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:\\n'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to\\ngrant this.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nIt is fifteen years since I saw my country: though\\nI have for the most part been aired abroad, I\\ndesire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent\\nking, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling\\nsorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to\\nthink so, which is another spur to my departure.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nAs thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of\\nthy services by leaving me now: the need I have of\\nthee thine own goodness hath made; better not to\\nhave had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having\\nmade me businesses which none without thee can\\nsufficiently manage, must either stay to execute\\nthem thyself or take away with thee the very\\nservices thou hast done; which if I have not enough\\nconsidered, as too much I cannot, to be more\\nthankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit\\ntherein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal\\ncountry, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very\\nnaming punishes me with the remembrance of that\\npenitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,\\nmy brother; whose loss of his most precious queen\\nand children are even now to be afresh lamented.\\nSay to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my\\nson? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not\\nbeing gracious, than they are in losing them when\\nthey have approved their virtues.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What\\nhis happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I\\nhave missingly noted, he is of late much retired\\nfrom court and is less frequent to his princely\\nexercises than formerly he hath appeared.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI have considered so much, Camillo, and with some\\ncare; so far that I have eyes under my service which\\nlook upon his removedness; from whom I have this\\nintelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a\\nmost homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from\\nvery nothing, and beyond the imagination of his\\nneighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a\\ndaughter of most rare note: the report of her is\\nextended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThat's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I\\nfear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou\\nshalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not\\nappearing what we are, have some question with the\\nshepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not\\nuneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.\\nPrithee, be my present partner in this business, and\\nlay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI willingly obey your command.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nMy best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWhen daffodils begin to peer,\\nWith heigh! the doxy over the dale,\\nWhy, then comes in the sweet o' the year;\\nFor the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.\\nThe white sheet bleaching on the hedge,\\nWith heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!\\nDoth set my pugging tooth on edge;\\nFor a quart of ale is a dish for a king.\\nThe lark, that tirra-lyra chants,\\nWith heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,\\nAre summer songs for me and my aunts,\\nWhile we lie tumbling in the hay.\\nI have served Prince Florizel and in my time\\nwore three-pile; but now I am out of service:\\nBut shall I go mourn for that, my dear?\\nThe pale moon shines by night:\\nAnd when I wander here and there,\\nI then do most go right.\\nIf tinkers may have leave to live,\\nAnd bear the sow-skin budget,\\nThen my account I well may, give,\\nAnd in the stocks avouch it.\\nMy traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to\\nlesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who\\nbeing, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise\\na snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and\\ndrab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is\\nthe silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful\\non the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to\\nme: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought\\nof it. A prize! a prize!\\n\\nClown:\\nLet me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod\\nyields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred\\nshorn. what comes the wool to?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nClown:\\nI cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am\\nI to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound\\nof sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will\\nthis sister of mine do with rice? But my father\\nhath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it\\non. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for\\nthe shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good\\nones; but they are most of them means and bases; but\\none puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to\\nhorn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden\\npies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;\\nnutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I\\nmay beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of\\nraisins o' the sun.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO that ever I was born!\\n\\nClown:\\nI' the name of me--\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and\\nthen, death, death!\\n\\nClown:\\nAlack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay\\non thee, rather than have these off.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more\\nthan the stripes I have received, which are mighty\\nones and millions.\\n\\nClown:\\nAlas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a\\ngreat matter.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel\\nta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon\\nme.\\n\\nClown:\\nWhat, by a horseman, or a footman?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nA footman, sweet sir, a footman.\\n\\nClown:\\nIndeed, he should be a footman by the garments he\\nhas left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,\\nit hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,\\nI'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, good sir, tenderly, O!\\n\\nClown:\\nAlas, poor soul!\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my\\nshoulder-blade is out.\\n\\nClown:\\nHow now! canst stand?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nClown:\\nDost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNo, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have\\na kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,\\nunto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or\\nany thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;\\nthat kills my heart.\\n\\nClown:\\nWhat manner of fellow was he that robbed you?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nA fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with\\ntroll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the\\nprince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his\\nvirtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.\\n\\nClown:\\nHis vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped\\nout of the court: they cherish it to make it stay\\nthere; and yet it will no more but abide.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nVices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he\\nhath been since an ape-bearer; then a\\nprocess-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a\\nmotion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's\\nwife within a mile where my land and living lies;\\nand, having flown over many knavish professions, he\\nsettled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.\\n\\nClown:\\nOut upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts\\nwakes, fairs and bear-baitings.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nVery true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that\\nput me into this apparel.\\n\\nClown:\\nNot a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had\\nbut looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am\\nfalse of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant\\nhim.\\n\\nClown:\\nHow do you now?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nSweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and\\nwalk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace\\nsoftly towards my kinsman's.\\n\\nClown:\\nShall I bring thee on the way?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNo, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.\\n\\nClown:\\nThen fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our\\nsheep-shearing.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nProsper you, sweet sir!\\nYour purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.\\nI'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I\\nmake not this cheat bring out another and the\\nshearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name\\nput in the book of virtue!\\nJog on, jog on, the foot-path way,\\nAnd merrily hent the stile-a:\\nA merry heart goes all the day,\\nYour sad tires in a mile-a.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nThese your unusual weeds to each part of you\\nDo give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora\\nPeering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing\\nIs as a meeting of the petty gods,\\nAnd you the queen on't.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSir, my gracious lord,\\nTo chide at your extremes it not becomes me:\\nO, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,\\nThe gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured\\nWith a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,\\nMost goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts\\nIn every mess have folly and the feeders\\nDigest it with a custom, I should blush\\nTo see you so attired, sworn, I think,\\nTo show myself a glass.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI bless the time\\nWhen my good falcon made her flight across\\nThy father's ground.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nNow Jove afford you cause!\\nTo me the difference forges dread; your greatness\\nHath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble\\nTo think your father, by some accident,\\nShould pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!\\nHow would he look, to see his work so noble\\nVilely bound up? What would he say? Or how\\nShould I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold\\nThe sternness of his presence?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nApprehend\\nNothing but jollity. The gods themselves,\\nHumbling their deities to love, have taken\\nThe shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter\\nBecame a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune\\nA ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,\\nGolden Apollo, a poor humble swain,\\nAs I seem now. Their transformations\\nWere never for a piece of beauty rarer,\\nNor in a way so chaste, since my desires\\nRun not before mine honour, nor my lusts\\nBurn hotter than my faith.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO, but, sir,\\nYour resolution cannot hold, when 'tis\\nOpposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:\\nOne of these two must be necessities,\\nWhich then will speak, that you must\\nchange this purpose,\\nOr I my life.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nThou dearest Perdita,\\nWith these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not\\nThe mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,\\nOr not my father's. For I cannot be\\nMine own, nor any thing to any, if\\nI be not thine. To this I am most constant,\\nThough destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;\\nStrangle such thoughts as these with any thing\\nThat you behold the while. Your guests are coming:\\nLift up your countenance, as it were the day\\nOf celebration of that nuptial which\\nWe two have sworn shall come.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO lady Fortune,\\nStand you auspicious!\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nSee, your guests approach:\\nAddress yourself to entertain them sprightly,\\nAnd let's be red with mirth.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nFie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon\\nThis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,\\nBoth dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;\\nWould sing her song and dance her turn; now here,\\nAt upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;\\nOn his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire\\nWith labour and the thing she took to quench it,\\nShe would to each one sip. You are retired,\\nAs if you were a feasted one and not\\nThe hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid\\nThese unknown friends to's welcome; for it is\\nA way to make us better friends, more known.\\nCome, quench your blushes and present yourself\\nThat which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,\\nAnd bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,\\nAs your good flock shall prosper.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nShepherdess,\\nA fair one are you--well you fit our ages\\nWith flowers of winter.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSir, the year growing ancient,\\nNot yet on summer's death, nor on the birth\\nOf trembling winter, the fairest\\nflowers o' the season\\nAre our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,\\nWhich some call nature's bastards: of that kind\\nOur rustic garden's barren; and I care not\\nTo get slips of them.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWherefore, gentle maiden,\\nDo you neglect them?\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nFor I have heard it said\\nThere is an art which in their piedness shares\\nWith great creating nature.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nSay there be;\\nYet nature is made better by no mean\\nBut nature makes that mean: so, over that art\\nWhich you say adds to nature, is an art\\nThat nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry\\nA gentler scion to the wildest stock,\\nAnd make conceive a bark of baser kind\\nBy bud of nobler race: this is an art\\nWhich does mend nature, change it rather, but\\nThe art itself is nature.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSo it is.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThen make your garden rich in gillyvors,\\nAnd do not call them bastards.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI'll not put\\nThe dibble in earth to set one slip of them;\\nNo more than were I painted I would wish\\nThis youth should say 'twere well and only therefore\\nDesire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;\\nHot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;\\nThe marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun\\nAnd with him rises weeping: these are flowers\\nOf middle summer, and I think they are given\\nTo men of middle age. You're very welcome.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI should leave grazing, were I of your flock,\\nAnd only live by gazing.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nOut, alas!\\nYou'd be so lean, that blasts of January\\nWould blow you through and through.\\nNow, my fair'st friend,\\nI would I had some flowers o' the spring that might\\nBecome your time of day; and yours, and yours,\\nThat wear upon your virgin branches yet\\nYour maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,\\nFor the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall\\nFrom Dis's waggon! daffodils,\\nThat come before the swallow dares, and take\\nThe winds of March with beauty; violets dim,\\nBut sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes\\nOr Cytherea's breath; pale primroses\\nThat die unmarried, ere they can behold\\nBight Phoebus in his strength--a malady\\nMost incident to maids; bold oxlips and\\nThe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,\\nThe flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,\\nTo make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,\\nTo strew him o'er and o'er!\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWhat, like a corse?\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nNo, like a bank for love to lie and play on;\\nNot like a corse; or if, not to be buried,\\nBut quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:\\nMethinks I play as I have seen them do\\nIn Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine\\nDoes change my disposition.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWhat you do\\nStill betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.\\nI'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,\\nI'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,\\nPray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,\\nTo sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you\\nA wave o' the sea, that you might ever do\\nNothing but that; move still, still so,\\nAnd own no other function: each your doing,\\nSo singular in each particular,\\nCrowns what you are doing in the present deed,\\nThat all your acts are queens.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO Doricles,\\nYour praises are too large: but that your youth,\\nAnd the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,\\nDo plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,\\nWith wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,\\nYou woo'd me the false way.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI think you have\\nAs little skill to fear as I have purpose\\nTo put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:\\nYour hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,\\nThat never mean to part.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI'll swear for 'em.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThis is the prettiest low-born lass that ever\\nRan on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems\\nBut smacks of something greater than herself,\\nToo noble for this place.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe tells her something\\nThat makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is\\nThe queen of curds and cream.\\n\\nClown:\\nCome on, strike up!\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nMopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,\\nTo mend her kissing with!\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nNow, in good time!\\n\\nClown:\\nNot a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.\\nCome, strike up!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nPray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this\\nWhich dances with your daughter?\\n\\nShepherd:\\nThey call him Doricles; and boasts himself\\nTo have a worthy feeding: but I have it\\nUpon his own report and I believe it;\\nHe looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:\\nI think so too; for never gazed the moon\\nUpon the water as he'll stand and read\\nAs 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.\\nI think there is not half a kiss to choose\\nWho loves another best.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nShe dances featly.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nSo she does any thing; though I report it,\\nThat should be silent: if young Doricles\\nDo light upon her, she shall bring him that\\nWhich he not dreams of.\\n\\nServant:\\nO master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the\\ndoor, you would never dance again after a tabour and\\npipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings\\nseveral tunes faster than you'll tell money; he\\nutters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's\\nears grew to his tunes.\\n\\nClown:\\nHe could never come better; he shall come in. I\\nlove a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful\\nmatter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing\\nindeed and sung lamentably.\\n\\nServant:\\nHe hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no\\nmilliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he\\nhas the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without\\nbawdry, which is strange; with such delicate\\nburthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump\\nher;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,\\nas it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into\\nthe matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me\\nno harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with\\n'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThis is a brave fellow.\\n\\nClown:\\nBelieve me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited\\nfellow. Has he any unbraided wares?\\n\\nServant:\\nHe hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;\\npoints more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can\\nlearnedly handle, though they come to him by the\\ngross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he\\nsings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you\\nwould think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants\\nto the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.\\n\\nClown:\\nPrithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nForewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.\\n\\nClown:\\nYou have of these pedlars, that have more in them\\nthan you'ld think, sister.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nAy, good brother, or go about to think.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nLawn as white as driven snow;\\nCyprus black as e'er was crow;\\nGloves as sweet as damask roses;\\nMasks for faces and for noses;\\nBugle bracelet, necklace amber,\\nPerfume for a lady's chamber;\\nGolden quoifs and stomachers,\\nFor my lads to give their dears:\\nPins and poking-sticks of steel,\\nWhat maids lack from head to heel:\\nCome buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;\\nBuy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.\\n\\nClown:\\nIf I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take\\nno money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it\\nwill also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nI was promised them against the feast; but they come\\nnot too late now.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nHe hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nHe hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has\\npaid you more, which will shame you to give him again.\\n\\nClown:\\nIs there no manners left among maids? will they\\nwear their plackets where they should bear their\\nfaces? Is there not milking-time, when you are\\ngoing to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these\\nsecrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all\\nour guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour\\nyour tongues, and not a word more.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nI have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace\\nand a pair of sweet gloves.\\n\\nClown:\\nHave I not told thee how I was cozened by the way\\nand lost all my money?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAnd indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;\\ntherefore it behoves men to be wary.\\n\\nClown:\\nFear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.\\n\\nClown:\\nWhat hast here? ballads?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nPray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'\\nlife, for then we are sure they are true.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHere's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's\\nwife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a\\nburthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and\\ntoads carbonadoed.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nIs it true, think you?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nVery true, and but a month old.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nBless me from marrying a usurer!\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHere's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress\\nTale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were\\npresent. Why should I carry lies abroad?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nPray you now, buy it.\\n\\nClown:\\nCome on, lay it by: and let's first see moe\\nballads; we'll buy the other things anon.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHere's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon\\nthe coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,\\nforty thousand fathom above water, and sung this\\nballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was\\nthought she was a woman and was turned into a cold\\nfish for she would not exchange flesh with one that\\nloved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nIs it true too, think you?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nFive justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than\\nmy pack will hold.\\n\\nClown:\\nLay it by too: another.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nThis is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nLet's have some merry ones.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWhy, this is a passing merry one and goes to\\nthe tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's\\nscarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in\\nrequest, I can tell you.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nWe can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou\\nshalt hear; 'tis in three parts.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWe had the tune on't a month ago.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI can bear my part; you must know 'tis my\\noccupation; have at it with you.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nGet you hence, for I must go\\nWhere it fits not you to know.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWhither?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nO, whither?\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWhither?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nIt becomes thy oath full well,\\nThou to me thy secrets tell.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nMe too, let me go thither.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nOr thou goest to the orange or mill.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nIf to either, thou dost ill.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNeither.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWhat, neither?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNeither.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nThou hast sworn my love to be.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nThou hast sworn it more to me:\\nThen whither goest? say, whither?\\n\\nClown:\\nWe'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my\\nfather and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll\\nnot trouble them.

'Tis time to part them.\\nHe's simple and tells much.\\nHow now, fair shepherd!\\nYour heart is full of something that does take\\nYour mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young\\nAnd handed love as you do, I was wont\\nTo load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd\\nThe pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it\\nTo her acceptance; you have let him go\\nAnd nothing marted with him. If your lass\\nInterpretation should abuse and call this\\nYour lack of love or bounty, you were straited\\nFor a reply, at least if you make a care\\nOf happy holding her.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nOld sir, I know\\nShe prizes not such trifles as these are:\\nThe gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd\\nUp in my heart; which I have given already,\\nBut not deliver'd.

I take thy hand, this hand,\\nAs soft as dove's down and as white as it,\\nOr Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd\\nsnow that's bolted\\nBy the northern blasts twice o'er.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWhat follows this?\\nHow prettily the young swain seems to wash\\nThe hand was fair before! I have put you out:\\nBut to your protestation; let me hear\\nWhat you profess.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nDo, and be witness to 't.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nAnd this my neighbour too?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nAnd he, and more\\nThan he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:\\nThat, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,\\nThereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth\\nThat ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge\\nMore than was ever man's, I would not prize them\\nWithout her love; for her employ them all;\\nCommend them and condemn them to her service\\nOr to their own perdition.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nFairly offer'd.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThis shows a sound affection.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nBut, my daughter,\\nSay you the like to him?\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI cannot speak\\nSo well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:\\nBy the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out\\nThe purity of his.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nTake hands, a bargain!\\nAnd, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:\\nI give my daughter to him, and will make\\nHer portion equal his.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nO, that must be\\nI' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,\\nI shall have more than you can dream of yet;\\nEnough then for your wonder. But, come on,\\nContract us 'fore these witnesses.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nCome, your hand;\\nAnd, daughter, yours.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nSoft, swain, awhile, beseech you;\\nHave you a father?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI have: but what of him?\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nKnows he of this?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nHe neither does nor shall.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nMethinks a father\\nIs at the nuptial of his son a guest\\nThat best becomes the table. Pray you once more,\\nIs not your father grown incapable\\nOf reasonable affairs? is he not stupid\\nWith age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?\\nKnow man from man? dispute his own estate?\\nLies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing\\nBut what he did being childish?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nNo, good sir;\\nHe has his health and ampler strength indeed\\nThan most have of his age.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nBy my white beard,\\nYou offer him, if this be so, a wrong\\nSomething unfilial: reason my son\\nShould choose himself a wife, but as good reason\\nThe father, all whose joy is nothing else\\nBut fair posterity, should hold some counsel\\nIn such a business.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI yield all this;\\nBut for some other reasons, my grave sir,\\nWhich 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint\\nMy father of this business.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nLet him know't.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nHe shall not.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nPrithee, let him.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nNo, he must not.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nLet him, my son: he shall not need to grieve\\nAt knowing of thy choice.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nCome, come, he must not.\\nMark our contract.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nMark your divorce, young sir,\\nWhom son I dare not call; thou art too base\\nTo be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,\\nThat thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,\\nI am sorry that by hanging thee I can\\nBut shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece\\nOf excellent witchcraft, who of force must know\\nThe royal fool thou copest with,--\\n\\nShepherd:\\nO, my heart!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made\\nMore homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,\\nIf I may ever know thou dost but sigh\\nThat thou no more shalt see this knack, as never\\nI mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;\\nNot hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,\\nFar than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:\\nFollow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,\\nThough full of our displeasure, yet we free thee\\nFrom the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--\\nWorthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,\\nThat makes himself, but for our honour therein,\\nUnworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou\\nThese rural latches to his entrance open,\\nOr hoop his body more with thy embraces,\\nI will devise a death as cruel for thee\\nAs thou art tender to't.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nEven here undone!\\nI was not much afeard; for once or twice\\nI was about to speak and tell him plainly,\\nThe selfsame sun that shines upon his court\\nHides not his visage from our cottage but\\nLooks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?\\nI told you what would come of this: beseech you,\\nOf your own state take care: this dream of mine,--\\nBeing now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,\\nBut milk my ewes and weep.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWhy, how now, father!\\nSpeak ere thou diest.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nI cannot speak, nor think\\nNor dare to know that which I know. O sir!\\nYou have undone a man of fourscore three,\\nThat thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,\\nTo die upon the bed my father died,\\nTo lie close by his honest bones: but now\\nSome hangman must put on my shroud and lay me\\nWhere no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,\\nThat knew'st this was the prince,\\nand wouldst adventure\\nTo mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!\\nIf I might die within this hour, I have lived\\nTo die when I desire.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWhy look you so upon me?\\nI am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,\\nBut nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;\\nMore straining on for plucking back, not following\\nMy leash unwillingly.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nGracious my lord,\\nYou know your father's temper: at this time\\nHe will allow no speech, which I do guess\\nYou do not purpose to him; and as hardly\\nWill he endure your sight as yet, I fear:\\nThen, till the fury of his highness settle,\\nCome not before him.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI not purpose it.\\nI think, Camillo?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nEven he, my lord.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nHow often have I told you 'twould be thus!\\nHow often said, my dignity would last\\nBut till 'twere known!\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nIt cannot fail but by\\nThe violation of my faith; and then\\nLet nature crush the sides o' the earth together\\nAnd mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:\\nFrom my succession wipe me, father; I\\nAm heir to my affection.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBe advised.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI am, and by my fancy: if my reason\\nWill thereto be obedient, I have reason;\\nIf not, my senses, better pleased with madness,\\nDo bid it welcome.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThis is desperate, sir.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nSo call it: but it does fulfil my vow;\\nI needs must think it honesty. Camillo,\\nNot for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may\\nBe thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or\\nThe close earth wombs or the profound sea hides\\nIn unknown fathoms, will I break my oath\\nTo this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,\\nAs you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,\\nWhen he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not\\nTo see him any more,--cast your good counsels\\nUpon his passion; let myself and fortune\\nTug for the time to come. This you may know\\nAnd so deliver, I am put to sea\\nWith her whom here I cannot hold on shore;\\nAnd most opportune to our need I have\\nA vessel rides fast by, but not prepared\\nFor this design. What course I mean to hold\\nShall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor\\nConcern me the reporting.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nO my lord!\\nI would your spirit were easier for advice,\\nOr stronger for your need.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nHark, Perdita\\nI'll hear you by and by.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe's irremoveable,\\nResolved for flight. Now were I happy, if\\nHis going I could frame to serve my turn,\\nSave him from danger, do him love and honour,\\nPurchase the sight again of dear Sicilia\\nAnd that unhappy king, my master, whom\\nI so much thirst to see.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nNow, good Camillo;\\nI am so fraught with curious business that\\nI leave out ceremony.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, I think\\nYou have heard of my poor services, i' the love\\nThat I have borne your father?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nVery nobly\\nHave you deserved: it is my father's music\\nTo speak your deeds, not little of his care\\nTo have them recompensed as thought on.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWell, my lord,\\nIf you may please to think I love the king\\nAnd through him what is nearest to him, which is\\nYour gracious self, embrace but my direction:\\nIf your more ponderous and settled project\\nMay suffer alteration, on mine honour,\\nI'll point you where you shall have such receiving\\nAs shall become your highness; where you may\\nEnjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,\\nThere's no disjunction to be made, but by--\\nAs heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,\\nAnd, with my best endeavours in your absence,\\nYour discontenting father strive to qualify\\nAnd bring him up to liking.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nHow, Camillo,\\nMay this, almost a miracle, be done?\\nThat I may call thee something more than man\\nAnd after that trust to thee.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHave you thought on\\nA place whereto you'll go?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nNot any yet:\\nBut as the unthought-on accident is guilty\\nTo what we wildly do, so we profess\\nOurselves to be the slaves of chance and flies\\nOf every wind that blows.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThen list to me:\\nThis follows, if you will not change your purpose\\nBut undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,\\nAnd there present yourself and your fair princess,\\nFor so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:\\nShe shall be habited as it becomes\\nThe partner of your bed. Methinks I see\\nLeontes opening his free arms and weeping\\nHis welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,\\nAs 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands\\nOf your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him\\n'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one\\nHe chides to hell and bids the other grow\\nFaster than thought or time.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWorthy Camillo,\\nWhat colour for my visitation shall I\\nHold up before him?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSent by the king your father\\nTo greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,\\nThe manner of your bearing towards him, with\\nWhat you as from your father shall deliver,\\nThings known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:\\nThe which shall point you forth at every sitting\\nWhat you must say; that he shall not perceive\\nBut that you have your father's bosom there\\nAnd speak his very heart.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI am bound to you:\\nThere is some sap in this.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nA cause more promising\\nThan a wild dedication of yourselves\\nTo unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain\\nTo miseries enough; no hope to help you,\\nBut as you shake off one to take another;\\nNothing so certain as your anchors, who\\nDo their best office, if they can but stay you\\nWhere you'll be loath to be: besides you know\\nProsperity's the very bond of love,\\nWhose fresh complexion and whose heart together\\nAffliction alters.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nOne of these is true:\\nI think affliction may subdue the cheek,\\nBut not take in the mind.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nYea, say you so?\\nThere shall not at your father's house these\\nseven years\\nBe born another such.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nMy good Camillo,\\nShe is as forward of her breeding as\\nShe is i' the rear our birth.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI cannot say 'tis pity\\nShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress\\nTo most that teach.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nYour pardon, sir; for this\\nI'll blush you thanks.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nMy prettiest Perdita!\\nBut O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,\\nPreserver of my father, now of me,\\nThe medicine of our house, how shall we do?\\nWe are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,\\nNor shall appear in Sicilia.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nMy lord,\\nFear none of this: I think you know my fortunes\\nDo all lie there: it shall be so my care\\nTo have you royally appointed as if\\nThe scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,\\nThat you may know you shall not want, one word.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHa, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his\\nsworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold\\nall my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a\\nribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,\\nknife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,\\nto keep my pack from fasting: they throng who\\nshould buy first, as if my trinkets had been\\nhallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:\\nby which means I saw whose purse was best in\\npicture; and what I saw, to my good use I\\nremembered. My clown, who wants but something to\\nbe a reasonable man, grew so in love with the\\nwenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes\\ntill he had both tune and words; which so drew the\\nrest of the herd to me that all their other senses\\nstuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it\\nwas senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a\\npurse; I could have filed keys off that hung in\\nchains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,\\nand admiring the nothing of it. So that in this\\ntime of lethargy I picked and cut most of their\\nfestival purses; and had not the old man come in\\nwith a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's\\nson and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not\\nleft a purse alive in the whole army.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNay, but my letters, by this means being there\\nSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nAnd those that you'll procure from King Leontes--\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nShall satisfy your father.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nHappy be you!\\nAll that you speak shows fair.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWho have we here?\\nWe'll make an instrument of this, omit\\nNothing may give us aid.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nIf they have overheard me now, why, hanging.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHow now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear\\nnot, man; here's no harm intended to thee.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI am a poor fellow, sir.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWhy, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from\\nthee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must\\nmake an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,\\n--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and\\nchange garments with this gentleman: though the\\npennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,\\nthere's some boot.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI am a poor fellow, sir.\\nI know ye well enough.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half\\nflayed already.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAre you in earnest, sir?\\nI smell the trick on't.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nDispatch, I prithee.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nIndeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with\\nconscience take it.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nUnbuckle, unbuckle.\\nFortunate mistress,--let my prophecy\\nCome home to ye!--you must retire yourself\\nInto some covert: take your sweetheart's hat\\nAnd pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,\\nDismantle you, and, as you can, disliken\\nThe truth of your own seeming; that you may--\\nFor I do fear eyes over--to shipboard\\nGet undescried.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI see the play so lies\\nThat I must bear a part.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNo remedy.\\nHave you done there?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nShould I now meet my father,\\nHe would not call me son.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNay, you shall have no hat.\\nCome, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAdieu, sir.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nO Perdita, what have we twain forgot!\\nPray you, a word.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nFortune speed us!\\nThus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThe swifter speed the better.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI understand the business, I hear it: to have an\\nopen ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is\\nnecessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite\\nalso, to smell out work for the other senses. I see\\nthis is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.\\nWhat an exchange had this been without boot! What\\na boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do\\nthis year connive at us, and we may do any thing\\nextempore. The prince himself is about a piece of\\niniquity, stealing away from his father with his\\nclog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of\\nhonesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not\\ndo't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;\\nand therein am I constant to my profession.\\nAside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:\\nevery lane's end, every shop, church, session,\\nhanging, yields a careful man work.\\n\\nClown:\\nSee, see; what a man you are now!\\nThere is no other way but to tell the king\\nshe's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nNay, but hear me.\\n\\nClown:\\nNay, but hear me.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nGo to, then.\\n\\nClown:\\nShe being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh\\nand blood has not offended the king; and so your\\nflesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show\\nthose things you found about her, those secret\\nthings, all but what she has with her: this being\\ndone, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nI will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his\\nson's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,\\nneither to his father nor to me, to go about to make\\nme the king's brother-in-law.\\n\\nClown:\\nIndeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you\\ncould have been to him and then your blood had been\\nthe dearer by I know how much an ounce.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWell, let us to the king: there is that in this\\nfardel will make him scratch his beard.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nClown:\\nPray heartily he be at palace.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nShepherd:\\nTo the palace, an it like your worship.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nYour affairs there, what, with whom, the condition\\nof that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your\\nnames, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any\\nthing that is fitting to be known, discover.\\n\\nClown:\\nWe are but plain fellows, sir.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nA lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no\\nlying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they\\noften give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for\\nit with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore\\nthey do not give us the lie.\\n\\nClown:\\nYour worship had like to have given us one, if you\\nhad not taken yourself with the manner.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nAre you a courtier, an't like you, sir?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWhether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest\\nthou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?\\nhath not my gait in it the measure of the court?\\nreceives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I\\nnot on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,\\nfor that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy\\nbusiness, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier\\ncap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck\\nback thy business there: whereupon I command thee to\\nopen thy affair.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nMy business, sir, is to the king.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWhat advocate hast thou to him?\\n\\nShepherd:\\nI know not, an't like you.\\n\\nClown:\\nAdvocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you\\nhave none.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nNone, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHow blessed are we that are not simple men!\\nYet nature might have made me as these are,\\nTherefore I will not disdain.\\n\\nClown:\\nThis cannot be but a great courtier.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nHis garments are rich, but he wears\\nthem not handsomely.\\n\\nClown:\\nHe seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:\\na great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking\\non's teeth.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nThe fardel there? what's i' the fardel?\\nWherefore that box?\\n\\nShepherd:\\nSir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,\\nwhich none must know but the king; and which he\\nshall know within this hour, if I may come to the\\nspeech of him.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAge, thou hast lost thy labour.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWhy, sir?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nThe king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a\\nnew ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,\\nif thou beest capable of things serious, thou must\\nknow the king is full of grief.\\n\\nShepard:\\nSo 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have\\nmarried a shepherd's daughter.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nIf that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:\\nthe curses he shall have, the tortures he shall\\nfeel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.\\n\\nClown:\\nThink you so, sir?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNot he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy\\nand vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to\\nhim, though removed fifty times, shall all come\\nunder the hangman: which though it be great pity,\\nyet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a\\nram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into\\ngrace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death\\nis too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a\\nsheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.\\n\\nClown:\\nHas the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't\\nlike you, sir?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHe has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then\\n'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a\\nwasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters\\nand a dram dead; then recovered again with\\naqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as\\nhe is, and in the hottest day prognostication\\nproclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the\\nsun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he\\nis to behold him with flies blown to death. But what\\ntalk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries\\nare to be smiled at, their offences being so\\ncapital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain\\nmen, what you have to the king: being something\\ngently considered, I'll bring you where he is\\naboard, tender your persons to his presence,\\nwhisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man\\nbesides the king to effect your suits, here is man\\nshall do it.\\n\\nClown:\\nHe seems to be of great authority: close with him,\\ngive him gold; and though authority be a stubborn\\nbear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show\\nthe inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,\\nand no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'\\n\\nShepherd:\\nAn't please you, sir, to undertake the business for\\nus, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much\\nmore and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAfter I have done what I promised?\\n\\nShepherd:\\nAy, sir.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWell, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?\\n\\nClown:\\nIn some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful\\none, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,\\nhe'll be made an example.\\n\\nClown:\\nComfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show\\nour strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your\\ndaughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I\\nwill give you as much as this old man does when the\\nbusiness is performed, and remain, as he says, your\\npawn till it be brought you.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;\\ngo on the right hand: I will but look upon the\\nhedge and follow you.\\n\\nClown:\\nWe are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nLet's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nIf I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would\\nnot suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am\\ncourted now with a double occasion, gold and a means\\nto do the prince my master good; which who knows how\\nthat may turn back to my advancement? I will bring\\nthese two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he\\nthink it fit to shore them again and that the\\ncomplaint they have to the king concerns him\\nnothing, let him call me rogue for being so far\\nofficious; for I am proof against that title and\\nwhat shame else belongs to't. To him will I present\\nthem: there may be matter in it.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nSir, you have done enough, and have perform'd\\nA saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,\\nWhich you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down\\nMore penitence than done trespass: at the last,\\nDo as the heavens have done, forget your evil;\\nWith them forgive yourself.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhilst I remember\\nHer and her virtues, I cannot forget\\nMy blemishes in them, and so still think of\\nThe wrong I did myself; which was so much,\\nThat heirless it hath made my kingdom and\\nDestroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man\\nBred his hopes out of.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nTrue, too true, my lord:\\nIf, one by one, you wedded all the world,\\nOr from the all that are took something good,\\nTo make a perfect woman, she you kill'd\\nWould be unparallel'd.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI think so. Kill'd!\\nShe I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me\\nSorely, to say I did; it is as bitter\\nUpon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,\\nSay so but seldom.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nNot at all, good lady:\\nYou might have spoken a thousand things that would\\nHave done the time more benefit and graced\\nYour kindness better.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nYou are one of those\\nWould have him wed again.\\n\\nDION:\\nIf you would not so,\\nYou pity not the state, nor the remembrance\\nOf his most sovereign name; consider little\\nWhat dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,\\nMay drop upon his kingdom and devour\\nIncertain lookers on. What were more holy\\nThan to rejoice the former queen is well?\\nWhat holier than, for royalty's repair,\\nFor present comfort and for future good,\\nTo bless the bed of majesty again\\nWith a sweet fellow to't?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThere is none worthy,\\nRespecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods\\nWill have fulfill'd their secret purposes;\\nFor has not the divine Apollo said,\\nIs't not the tenor of his oracle,\\nThat King Leontes shall not have an heir\\nTill his lost child be found? which that it shall,\\nIs all as monstrous to our human reason\\nAs my Antigonus to break his grave\\nAnd come again to me; who, on my life,\\nDid perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel\\nMy lord should to the heavens be contrary,\\nOppose against their wills.\\nCare not for issue;\\nThe crown will find an heir: great Alexander\\nLeft his to the worthiest; so his successor\\nWas like to be the best.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGood Paulina,\\nWho hast the memory of Hermione,\\nI know, in honour, O, that ever I\\nHad squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,\\nI might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,\\nHave taken treasure from her lips--\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nAnd left them\\nMore rich for what they yielded.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou speak'st truth.\\nNo more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,\\nAnd better used, would make her sainted spirit\\nAgain possess her corpse, and on this stage,\\nWhere we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,\\nAnd begin, 'Why to me?'\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nHad she such power,\\nShe had just cause.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nShe had; and would incense me\\nTo murder her I married.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI should so.\\nWere I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark\\nHer eye, and tell me for what dull part in't\\nYou chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears\\nShould rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd\\nShould be 'Remember mine.'\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nStars, stars,\\nAnd all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;\\nI'll have no wife, Paulina.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWill you swear\\nNever to marry but by my free leave?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNever, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThen, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nYou tempt him over-much.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nUnless another,\\nAs like Hermione as is her picture,\\nAffront his eye.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nGood madam,--\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI have done.\\nYet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,\\nNo remedy, but you will,--give me the office\\nTo choose you a queen: she shall not be so young\\nAs was your former; but she shall be such\\nAs, walk'd your first queen's ghost,\\nit should take joy\\nTo see her in your arms.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nMy true Paulina,\\nWe shall not marry till thou bid'st us.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThat\\nShall be when your first queen's again in breath;\\nNever till then.\\n\\nGentleman:\\nOne that gives out himself Prince Florizel,\\nSon of Polixenes, with his princess, she\\nThe fairest I have yet beheld, desires access\\nTo your high presence.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat with him? he comes not\\nLike to his father's greatness: his approach,\\nSo out of circumstance and sudden, tells us\\n'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced\\nBy need and accident. What train?\\n\\nGentleman:\\nBut few,\\nAnd those but mean.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHis princess, say you, with him?\\n\\nGentleman:\\nAy, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,\\nThat e'er the sun shone bright on.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nO Hermione,\\nAs every present time doth boast itself\\nAbove a better gone, so must thy grave\\nGive way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself\\nHave said and writ so, but your writing now\\nIs colder than that theme, 'She had not been,\\nNor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse\\nFlow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,\\nTo say you have seen a better.\\n\\nGentleman:\\nPardon, madam:\\nThe one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--\\nThe other, when she has obtain'd your eye,\\nWill have your tongue too. This is a creature,\\nWould she begin a sect, might quench the zeal\\nOf all professors else, make proselytes\\nOf who she but bid follow.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nHow! not women?\\n\\nGentleman:\\nWomen will love her, that she is a woman\\nMore worth than any man; men, that she is\\nThe rarest of all women.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo, Cleomenes;\\nYourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,\\nBring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange\\nHe thus should steal upon us.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nHad our prince,\\nJewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd\\nWell with this lord: there was not full a month\\nBetween their births.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nPrithee, no more; cease; thou know'st\\nHe dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,\\nWhen I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches\\nWill bring me to consider that which may\\nUnfurnish me of reason. They are come.\\nYour mother was most true to wedlock, prince;\\nFor she did print your royal father off,\\nConceiving you: were I but twenty-one,\\nYour father's image is so hit in you,\\nHis very air, that I should call you brother,\\nAs I did him, and speak of something wildly\\nBy us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!\\nAnd your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!\\nI lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth\\nMight thus have stood begetting wonder as\\nYou, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--\\nAll mine own folly--the society,\\nAmity too, of your brave father, whom,\\nThough bearing misery, I desire my life\\nOnce more to look on him.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nBy his command\\nHave I here touch'd Sicilia and from him\\nGive you all greetings that a king, at friend,\\nCan send his brother: and, but infirmity\\nWhich waits upon worn times hath something seized\\nHis wish'd ability, he had himself\\nThe lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his\\nMeasured to look upon you; whom he loves--\\nHe bade me say so--more than all the sceptres\\nAnd those that bear them living.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO my brother,\\nGood gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir\\nAfresh within me, and these thy offices,\\nSo rarely kind, are as interpreters\\nOf my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,\\nAs is the spring to the earth. And hath he too\\nExposed this paragon to the fearful usage,\\nAt least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,\\nTo greet a man not worth her pains, much less\\nThe adventure of her person?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nGood my lord,\\nShe came from Libya.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhere the warlike Smalus,\\nThat noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nMost royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter\\nHis tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,\\nA prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,\\nTo execute the charge my father gave me\\nFor visiting your highness: my best train\\nI have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;\\nWho for Bohemia bend, to signify\\nNot only my success in Libya, sir,\\nBut my arrival and my wife's in safety\\nHere where we are.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThe blessed gods\\nPurge all infection from our air whilst you\\nDo climate here! You have a holy father,\\nA graceful gentleman; against whose person,\\nSo sacred as it is, I have done sin:\\nFor which the heavens, taking angry note,\\nHave left me issueless; and your father's blest,\\nAs he from heaven merits it, with you\\nWorthy his goodness. What might I have been,\\nMight I a son and daughter now have look'd on,\\nSuch goodly things as you!\\n\\nLord:\\nMost noble sir,\\nThat which I shall report will bear no credit,\\nWere not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,\\nBohemia greets you from himself by me;\\nDesires you to attach his son, who has--\\nHis dignity and duty both cast off--\\nFled from his father, from his hopes, and with\\nA shepherd's daughter.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhere's Bohemia? speak.\\n\\nLord:\\nHere in your city; I now came from him:\\nI speak amazedly; and it becomes\\nMy marvel and my message. To your court\\nWhiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,\\nOf this fair couple, meets he on the way\\nThe father of this seeming lady and\\nHer brother, having both their country quitted\\nWith this young prince.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nCamillo has betray'd me;\\nWhose honour and whose honesty till now\\nEndured all weathers.\\n\\nLord:\\nLay't so to his charge:\\nHe's with the king your father.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWho? Camillo?\\n\\nLord:\\nCamillo, sir; I spake with him; who now\\nHas these poor men in question. Never saw I\\nWretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;\\nForswear themselves as often as they speak:\\nBohemia stops his ears, and threatens them\\nWith divers deaths in death.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO my poor father!\\nThe heaven sets spies upon us, will not have\\nOur contract celebrated.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou are married?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWe are not, sir, nor are we like to be;\\nThe stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:\\nThe odds for high and low's alike.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nMy lord,\\nIs this the daughter of a king?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nShe is,\\nWhen once she is my wife.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThat 'once' I see by your good father's speed\\nWill come on very slowly. I am sorry,\\nMost sorry, you have broken from his liking\\nWhere you were tied in duty, and as sorry\\nYour choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,\\nThat you might well enjoy her.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nDear, look up:\\nThough Fortune, visible an enemy,\\nShould chase us with my father, power no jot\\nHath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,\\nRemember since you owed no more to time\\nThan I do now: with thought of such affections,\\nStep forth mine advocate; at your request\\nMy father will grant precious things as trifles.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWould he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,\\nWhich he counts but a trifle.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nSir, my liege,\\nYour eye hath too much youth in't: not a month\\n'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes\\nThan what you look on now.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI thought of her,\\nEven in these looks I made.\\nBut your petition\\nIs yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:\\nYour honour not o'erthrown by your desires,\\nI am friend to them and you: upon which errand\\nI now go toward him; therefore follow me\\nAnd mark what way I make: come, good my lord.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nBeseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nI was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old\\nshepherd deliver the manner how he found it:\\nwhereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all\\ncommanded out of the chamber; only this methought I\\nheard the shepherd say, he found the child.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI would most gladly know the issue of it.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nI make a broken delivery of the business; but the\\nchanges I perceived in the king and Camillo were\\nvery notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with\\nstaring on one another, to tear the cases of their\\neyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language\\nin their very gesture; they looked as they had heard\\nof a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable\\npassion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest\\nbeholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not\\nsay if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the\\nextremity of the one, it must needs be.\\nHere comes a gentleman that haply knows more.\\nThe news, Rogero?\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nNothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the\\nking's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is\\nbroken out within this hour that ballad-makers\\ncannot be able to express it.\\nHere comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can\\ndeliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news\\nwhich is called true is so like an old tale, that\\nthe verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king\\nfound his heir?\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nMost true, if ever truth were pregnant by\\ncircumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you\\nsee, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle\\nof Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,\\nthe letters of Antigonus found with it which they\\nknow to be his character, the majesty of the\\ncreature in resemblance of the mother, the affection\\nof nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,\\nand many other evidences proclaim her with all\\ncertainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see\\nthe meeting of the two kings?\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nNo.\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nThen have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,\\ncannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one\\njoy crown another, so and in such manner that it\\nseemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their\\njoy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,\\nholding up of hands, with countenances of such\\ndistraction that they were to be known by garment,\\nnot by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of\\nhimself for joy of his found daughter, as if that\\njoy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,\\nthy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then\\nembraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his\\ndaughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old\\nshepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten\\nconduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such\\nanother encounter, which lames report to follow it\\nand undoes description to do it.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nWhat, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried\\nhence the child?\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nLike an old tale still, which will have matter to\\nrehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear\\nopen. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this\\navouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his\\ninnocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a\\nhandkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nWhat became of his bark and his followers?\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nWrecked the same instant of their master's death and\\nin the view of the shepherd: so that all the\\ninstruments which aided to expose the child were\\neven then lost when it was found. But O, the noble\\ncombat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in\\nPaulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of\\nher husband, another elevated that the oracle was\\nfulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,\\nand so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin\\nher to her heart that she might no more be in danger\\nof losing.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nThe dignity of this act was worth the audience of\\nkings and princes; for by such was it acted.\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nOne of the prettiest touches of all and that which\\nangled for mine eyes, caught the water though not\\nthe fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's\\ndeath, with the manner how she came to't bravely\\nconfessed and lamented by the king, how\\nattentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one\\nsign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'\\nI would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my\\nheart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed\\ncolour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world\\ncould have seen 't, the woe had been universal.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nAre they returned to the court?\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nNo: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,\\nwhich is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many\\nyears in doing and now newly performed by that rare\\nItalian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself\\neternity and could put breath into his work, would\\nbeguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her\\nape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that\\nthey say one would speak to her and stand in hope of\\nanswer: thither with all greediness of affection\\nare they gone, and there they intend to sup.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nI thought she had some great matter there in hand;\\nfor she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever\\nsince the death of Hermione, visited that removed\\nhouse. Shall we thither and with our company piece\\nthe rejoicing?\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nWho would be thence that has the benefit of access?\\nevery wink of an eye some new grace will be born:\\nour absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.\\nLet's along.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNow, had I not the dash of my former life in me,\\nwould preferment drop on my head. I brought the old\\nman and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard\\nthem talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he\\nat that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,\\nso he then took her to be, who began to be much\\nsea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of\\nweather continuing, this mystery remained\\nundiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I\\nbeen the finder out of this secret, it would not\\nhave relished among my other discredits.\\nHere come those I have done good to against my will,\\nand already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nCome, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and\\ndaughters will be all gentlemen born.\\n\\nClown:\\nYou are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me\\nthis other day, because I was no gentleman born.\\nSee you these clothes? say you see them not and\\nthink me still no gentleman born: you were best say\\nthese robes are not gentlemen born: give me the\\nlie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.\\n\\nClown:\\nAy, and have been so any time these four hours.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nAnd so have I, boy.\\n\\nClown:\\nSo you have: but I was a gentleman born before my\\nfather; for the king's son took me by the hand, and\\ncalled me brother; and then the two kings called my\\nfather brother; and then the prince my brother and\\nthe princess my sister called my father father; and\\nso we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like\\ntears that ever we shed.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWe may live, son, to shed many more.\\n\\nClown:\\nAy; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so\\npreposterous estate as we are.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the\\nfaults I have committed to your worship and to give\\nme your good report to the prince my master.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nPrithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are\\ngentlemen.\\n\\nClown:\\nThou wilt amend thy life?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAy, an it like your good worship.\\n\\nClown:\\nGive me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou\\nart as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nYou may say it, but not swear it.\\n\\nClown:\\nNot swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and\\nfranklins say it, I'll swear it.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nHow if it be false, son?\\n\\nClown:\\nIf it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear\\nit in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to\\nthe prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and\\nthat thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no\\ntall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be\\ndrunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst\\nbe a tall fellow of thy hands.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI will prove so, sir, to my power.\\n\\nClown:\\nAy, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not\\nwonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not\\nbeing a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings\\nand the princes, our kindred, are going to see the\\nqueen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy\\ngood masters.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO grave and good Paulina, the great comfort\\nThat I have had of thee!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWhat, sovereign sir,\\nI did not well I meant well. All my services\\nYou have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,\\nWith your crown'd brother and these your contracted\\nHeirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,\\nIt is a surplus of your grace, which never\\nMy life may last to answer.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO Paulina,\\nWe honour you with trouble: but we came\\nTo see the statue of our queen: your gallery\\nHave we pass'd through, not without much content\\nIn many singularities; but we saw not\\nThat which my daughter came to look upon,\\nThe statue of her mother.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nAs she lived peerless,\\nSo her dead likeness, I do well believe,\\nExcels whatever yet you look'd upon\\nOr hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it\\nLonely, apart. But here it is: prepare\\nTo see the life as lively mock'd as ever\\nStill sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.\\nI like your silence, it the more shows off\\nYour wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,\\nComes it not something near?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHer natural posture!\\nChide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed\\nThou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she\\nIn thy not chiding, for she was as tender\\nAs infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,\\nHermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing\\nSo aged as this seems.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nO, not by much.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nSo much the more our carver's excellence;\\nWhich lets go by some sixteen years and makes her\\nAs she lived now.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAs now she might have done,\\nSo much to my good comfort, as it is\\nNow piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,\\nEven with such life of majesty, warm life,\\nAs now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!\\nI am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me\\nFor being more stone than it? O royal piece,\\nThere's magic in thy majesty, which has\\nMy evils conjured to remembrance and\\nFrom thy admiring daughter took the spirits,\\nStanding like stone with thee.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nAnd give me leave,\\nAnd do not say 'tis superstition, that\\nI kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,\\nDear queen, that ended when I but began,\\nGive me that hand of yours to kiss.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nO, patience!\\nThe statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nMy lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,\\nWhich sixteen winters cannot blow away,\\nSo many summers dry; scarce any joy\\nDid ever so long live; no sorrow\\nBut kill'd itself much sooner.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nDear my brother,\\nLet him that was the cause of this have power\\nTo take off so much grief from you as he\\nWill piece up in himself.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nIndeed, my lord,\\nIf I had thought the sight of my poor image\\nWould thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--\\nI'ld not have show'd it.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nDo not draw the curtain.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNo longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy\\nMay think anon it moves.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nLet be, let be.\\nWould I were dead, but that, methinks, already--\\nWhat was he that did make it? See, my lord,\\nWould you not deem it breathed? and that those veins\\nDid verily bear blood?\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nMasterly done:\\nThe very life seems warm upon her lip.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThe fixture of her eye has motion in't,\\nAs we are mock'd with art.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI'll draw the curtain:\\nMy lord's almost so far transported that\\nHe'll think anon it lives.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO sweet Paulina,\\nMake me to think so twenty years together!\\nNo settled senses of the world can match\\nThe pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but\\nI could afflict you farther.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nDo, Paulina;\\nFor this affliction has a taste as sweet\\nAs any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,\\nThere is an air comes from her: what fine chisel\\nCould ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,\\nFor I will kiss her.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nGood my lord, forbear:\\nThe ruddiness upon her lip is wet;\\nYou'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own\\nWith oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo, not these twenty years.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSo long could I\\nStand by, a looker on.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nEither forbear,\\nQuit presently the chapel, or resolve you\\nFor more amazement. If you can behold it,\\nI'll make the statue move indeed, descend\\nAnd take you by the hand; but then you'll think--\\nWhich I protest against--I am assisted\\nBy wicked powers.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat you can make her do,\\nI am content to look on: what to speak,\\nI am content to hear; for 'tis as easy\\nTo make her speak as move.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nIt is required\\nYou do awake your faith. Then all stand still;\\nOn: those that think it is unlawful business\\nI am about, let them depart.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nProceed:\\nNo foot shall stir.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nMusic, awake her; strike!\\n'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;\\nStrike all that look upon with marvel. Come,\\nI'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,\\nBequeath to death your numbness, for from him\\nDear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:\\nStart not; her actions shall be holy as\\nYou hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her\\nUntil you see her die again; for then\\nYou kill her double. Nay, present your hand:\\nWhen she was young you woo'd her; now in age\\nIs she become the suitor?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO, she's warm!\\nIf this be magic, let it be an art\\nLawful as eating.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nShe embraces him.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nShe hangs about his neck:\\nIf she pertain to life let her speak too.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nAy, and make't manifest where she has lived,\\nOr how stolen from the dead.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThat she is living,\\nWere it but told you, should be hooted at\\nLike an old tale: but it appears she lives,\\nThough yet she speak not. Mark a little while.\\nPlease you to interpose, fair madam: kneel\\nAnd pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;\\nOur Perdita is found.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nYou gods, look down\\nAnd from your sacred vials pour your graces\\nUpon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.\\nWhere hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found\\nThy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,\\nKnowing by Paulina that the oracle\\nGave hope thou wast in being, have preserved\\nMyself to see the issue.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThere's time enough for that;\\nLest they desire upon this push to trouble\\nYour joys with like relation. Go together,\\nYou precious winners all; your exultation\\nPartake to every one. I, an old turtle,\\nWill wing me to some wither'd bough and there\\nMy mate, that's never to be found again,\\nLament till I am lost.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO, peace, Paulina!\\nThou shouldst a husband take by my consent,\\nAs I by thine a wife: this is a match,\\nAnd made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;\\nBut how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,\\nAs I thought, dead, and have in vain said many\\nA prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--\\nFor him, I partly know his mind--to find thee\\nAn honourable husband. Come, Camillo,\\nAnd take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty\\nIs richly noted and here justified\\nBy us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.\\nWhat! look upon my brother: both your pardons,\\nThat e'er I put between your holy looks\\nMy ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,\\nAnd son unto the king, who, heavens directing,\\nIs troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,\\nLead us from hence, where we may leisurely\\nEach one demand an answer to his part\\nPerform'd in this wide gap of time since first\\nWe were dissever'd: hastily lead away.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nEscalus.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nMy lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nOf government the properties to unfold,\\nWould seem in me to affect speech and discourse;\\nSince I am put to know that your own science\\nExceeds, in that, the lists of all advice\\nMy strength can give you: then no more remains,\\nBut that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able,\\nAnd let them work. The nature of our people,\\nOur city's institutions, and the terms\\nFor common justice, you're as pregnant in\\nAs art and practise hath enriched any\\nThat we remember. There is our commission,\\nFrom which we would not have you warp. Call hither,\\nI say, bid come before us Angelo.\\nWhat figure of us think you he will bear?\\nFor you must know, we have with special soul\\nElected him our absence to supply,\\nLent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,\\nAnd given his deputation all the organs\\nOf our own power: what think you of it?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nIf any in Vienna be of worth\\nTo undergo such ample grace and honour,\\nIt is Lord Angelo.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nLook where he comes.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAlways obedient to your grace's will,\\nI come to know your pleasure.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAngelo,\\nThere is a kind of character in thy life,\\nThat to the observer doth thy history\\nFully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings\\nAre not thine own so proper as to waste\\nThyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.\\nHeaven doth with us as we with torches do,\\nNot light them for themselves; for if our virtues\\nDid not go forth of us, 'twere all alike\\nAs if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd\\nBut to fine issues, nor Nature never lends\\nThe smallest scruple of her excellence\\nBut, like a thrifty goddess, she determines\\nHerself the glory of a creditor,\\nBoth thanks and use. But I do bend my speech\\nTo one that can my part in him advertise;\\nHold therefore, Angelo:--\\nIn our remove be thou at full ourself;\\nMortality and mercy in Vienna\\nLive in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,\\nThough first in question, is thy secondary.\\nTake thy commission.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nNow, good my lord,\\nLet there be some more test made of my metal,\\nBefore so noble and so great a figure\\nBe stamp'd upon it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNo more evasion:\\nWe have with a leaven'd and prepared choice\\nProceeded to you; therefore take your honours.\\nOur haste from hence is of so quick condition\\nThat it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd\\nMatters of needful value.

Let us withdraw together,\\nAnd we may soon our satisfaction have\\nTouching that point.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI'll wait upon your honour.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIf the duke with the other dukes come not to\\ncomposition with the King of Hungary, why then all\\nthe dukes fall upon the king.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nHeaven grant us its peace, but not the King of\\nHungary's!\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nAmen.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that\\nwent to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped\\none out of the table.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\n'Thou shalt not steal'?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nAy, that he razed.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nWhy, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and\\nall the rest from their functions: they put forth\\nto steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in\\nthe thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition\\nwell that prays for peace.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nI never heard any soldier dislike it.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI believe thee; for I think thou never wast where\\ngrace was said.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nNo? a dozen times at least.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nWhat, in metre?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIn any proportion or in any language.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nI think, or in any religion.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nAy, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all\\ncontroversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a\\nwicked villain, despite of all grace.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nWell, there went but a pair of shears between us.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI grant; as there may between the lists and the\\nvelvet. Thou art the list.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nAnd thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt\\na three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief\\nbe a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou\\nart piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak\\nfeelingly now?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful\\nfeeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own\\nconfession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I\\nlive, forget to drink after thee.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nI think I have done myself wrong, have I not?\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nYes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBehold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I\\nhave purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nTo what, I pray?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nJudge.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nTo three thousand dolours a year.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nAy, and more.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nA French crown more.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nThou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou\\nart full of error; I am sound.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as\\nthings that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;\\nimpiety has made a feast of thee.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nHow now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWell, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried\\nto prison was worth five thousand of you all.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nWho's that, I pray thee?\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nMarry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nClaudio to prison? 'tis not so.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nNay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw\\nhim carried away; and, which is more, within these\\nthree days his head to be chopped off.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBut, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.\\nArt thou sure of this?\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nI am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam\\nJulietta with child.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBelieve me, this may be: he promised to meet me two\\nhours since, and he was ever precise in\\npromise-keeping.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nBesides, you know, it draws something near to the\\nspeech we had to such a purpose.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nBut, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nAway! let's go learn the truth of it.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nThus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what\\nwith the gallows and what with poverty, I am\\ncustom-shrunk.\\nHow now! what's the news with you?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nYonder man is carried to prison.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWell; what has he done?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nA woman.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nBut what's his offence?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nGroping for trouts in a peculiar river.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWhat, is there a maid with child by him?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nNo, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have\\nnot heard of the proclamation, have you?\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWhat proclamation, man?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nAll houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nAnd what shall become of those in the city?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nThey shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,\\nbut that a wise burgher put in for them.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nBut shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be\\npulled down?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nTo the ground, mistress.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWhy, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!\\nWhat shall become of me?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nCome; fear you not: good counsellors lack no\\nclients: though you change your place, you need not\\nchange your trade; I'll be your tapster still.\\nCourage! there will be pity taken on you: you that\\nhave worn your eyes almost out in the service, you\\nwill be considered.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWhat's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nHere comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to\\nprison; and there's Madam Juliet.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nFellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?\\nBear me to prison, where I am committed.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI do it not in evil disposition,\\nBut from Lord Angelo by special charge.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThus can the demigod Authority\\nMake us pay down for our offence by weight\\nThe words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;\\nOn whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhy, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nFrom too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:\\nAs surfeit is the father of much fast,\\nSo every scope by the immoderate use\\nTurns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,\\nLike rats that ravin down their proper bane,\\nA thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIf could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would\\nsend for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say\\nthe truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom\\nas the morality of imprisonment. What's thy\\noffence, Claudio?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nWhat but to speak of would offend again.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhat, is't murder?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nNo.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nLechery?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nCall it so.\\n\\nProvost:\\nAway, sir! you must go.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nOne word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nA hundred, if they'll do you any good.\\nIs lechery so look'd after?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThus stands it with me: upon a true contract\\nI got possession of Julietta's bed:\\nYou know the lady; she is fast my wife,\\nSave that we do the denunciation lack\\nOf outward order: this we came not to,\\nOnly for propagation of a dower\\nRemaining in the coffer of her friends,\\nFrom whom we thought it meet to hide our love\\nTill time had made them for us. But it chances\\nThe stealth of our most mutual entertainment\\nWith character too gross is writ on Juliet.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWith child, perhaps?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nUnhappily, even so.\\nAnd the new deputy now for the duke--\\nWhether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,\\nOr whether that the body public be\\nA horse whereon the governor doth ride,\\nWho, newly in the seat, that it may know\\nHe can command, lets it straight feel the spur;\\nWhether the tyranny be in his place,\\nOr in his emmence that fills it up,\\nI stagger in:--but this new governor\\nAwakes me all the enrolled penalties\\nWhich have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall\\nSo long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round\\nAnd none of them been worn; and, for a name,\\nNow puts the drowsy and neglected act\\nFreshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on\\nthy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,\\nmay sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to\\nhim.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nI have done so, but he's not to be found.\\nI prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:\\nThis day my sister should the cloister enter\\nAnd there receive her approbation:\\nAcquaint her with the danger of my state:\\nImplore her, in my voice, that she make friends\\nTo the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:\\nI have great hope in that; for in her youth\\nThere is a prone and speechless dialect,\\nSuch as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art\\nWhen she will play with reason and discourse,\\nAnd well she can persuade.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the\\nlike, which else would stand under grievous\\nimposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I\\nwould be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a\\ngame of tick-tack. I'll to her.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nI thank you, good friend Lucio.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWithin two hours.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nCome, officer, away!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNo, holy father; throw away that thought;\\nBelieve not that the dribbling dart of love\\nCan pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee\\nTo give me secret harbour, hath a purpose\\nMore grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends\\nOf burning youth.\\n\\nFRIAR THOMAS:\\nMay your grace speak of it?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMy holy sir, none better knows than you\\nHow I have ever loved the life removed\\nAnd held in idle price to haunt assemblies\\nWhere youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.\\nI have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,\\nA man of stricture and firm abstinence,\\nMy absolute power and place here in Vienna,\\nAnd he supposes me travell'd to Poland;\\nFor so I have strew'd it in the common ear,\\nAnd so it is received. Now, pious sir,\\nYou will demand of me why I do this?\\n\\nFRIAR THOMAS:\\nGladly, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWe have strict statutes and most biting laws.\\nThe needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,\\nWhich for this nineteen years we have let slip;\\nEven like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,\\nThat goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,\\nHaving bound up the threatening twigs of birch,\\nOnly to stick it in their children's sight\\nFor terror, not to use, in time the rod\\nBecomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,\\nDead to infliction, to themselves are dead;\\nAnd liberty plucks justice by the nose;\\nThe baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart\\nGoes all decorum.\\n\\nFRIAR THOMAS:\\nIt rested in your grace\\nTo unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:\\nAnd it in you more dreadful would have seem'd\\nThan in Lord Angelo.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI do fear, too dreadful:\\nSith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,\\n'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them\\nFor what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,\\nWhen evil deeds have their permissive pass\\nAnd not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,\\nI have on Angelo imposed the office;\\nWho may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,\\nAnd yet my nature never in the fight\\nTo do in slander. And to behold his sway,\\nI will, as 'twere a brother of your order,\\nVisit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,\\nSupply me with the habit and instruct me\\nHow I may formally in person bear me\\nLike a true friar. More reasons for this action\\nAt our more leisure shall I render you;\\nOnly, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;\\nStands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses\\nThat his blood flows, or that his appetite\\nIs more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,\\nIf power change purpose, what our seemers be.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAnd have you nuns no farther privileges?\\n\\nFRANCISCA:\\nAre not these large enough?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;\\nBut rather wishing a more strict restraint\\nUpon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWho's that which calls?\\n\\nFRANCISCA:\\nIt is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,\\nTurn you the key, and know his business of him;\\nYou may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.\\nWhen you have vow'd, you must not speak with men\\nBut in the presence of the prioress:\\nThen, if you speak, you must not show your face,\\nOr, if you show your face, you must not speak.\\nHe calls again; I pray you, answer him.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nPeace and prosperity! Who is't that calls\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nHail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses\\nProclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me\\nAs bring me to the sight of Isabella,\\nA novice of this place and the fair sister\\nTo her unhappy brother Claudio?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhy 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,\\nThe rather for I now must make you know\\nI am that Isabella and his sister.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nGentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:\\nNot to be weary with you, he's in prison.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWoe me! for what?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nFor that which, if myself might be his judge,\\nHe should receive his punishment in thanks:\\nHe hath got his friend with child.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nSir, make me not your story.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIt is true.\\nI would not--though 'tis my familiar sin\\nWith maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,\\nTongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:\\nI hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.\\nBy your renouncement an immortal spirit,\\nAnd to be talk'd with in sincerity,\\nAs with a saint.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYou do blaspheme the good in mocking me.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nDo not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:\\nYour brother and his lover have embraced:\\nAs those that feed grow full, as blossoming time\\nThat from the seedness the bare fallow brings\\nTo teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb\\nExpresseth his full tilth and husbandry.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nSome one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIs she your cousin?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAdoptedly; as school-maids change their names\\nBy vain though apt affection.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nShe it is.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, let him marry her.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThis is the point.\\nThe duke is very strangely gone from hence;\\nBore many gentlemen, myself being one,\\nIn hand and hope of action: but we do learn\\nBy those that know the very nerves of state,\\nHis givings-out were of an infinite distance\\nFrom his true-meant design. Upon his place,\\nAnd with full line of his authority,\\nGoverns Lord Angelo; a man whose blood\\nIs very snow-broth; one who never feels\\nThe wanton stings and motions of the sense,\\nBut doth rebate and blunt his natural edge\\nWith profits of the mind, study and fast.\\nHe--to give fear to use and liberty,\\nWhich have for long run by the hideous law,\\nAs mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,\\nUnder whose heavy sense your brother's life\\nFalls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;\\nAnd follows close the rigour of the statute,\\nTo make him an example. All hope is gone,\\nUnless you have the grace by your fair prayer\\nTo soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business\\n'Twixt you and your poor brother.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nDoth he so seek his life?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nHas censured him\\nAlready; and, as I hear, the provost hath\\nA warrant for his execution.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAlas! what poor ability's in me\\nTo do him good?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nAssay the power you have.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nMy power? Alas, I doubt--\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nOur doubts are traitors\\nAnd make us lose the good we oft might win\\nBy fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,\\nAnd let him learn to know, when maidens sue,\\nMen give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,\\nAll their petitions are as freely theirs\\nAs they themselves would owe them.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI'll see what I can do.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBut speedily.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI will about it straight;\\nNo longer staying but to give the mother\\nNotice of my affair. I humbly thank you:\\nCommend me to my brother: soon at night\\nI'll send him certain word of my success.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI take my leave of you.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nGood sir, adieu.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWe must not make a scarecrow of the law,\\nSetting it up to fear the birds of prey,\\nAnd let it keep one shape, till custom make it\\nTheir perch and not their terror.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nAy, but yet\\nLet us be keen, and rather cut a little,\\nThan fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman\\nWhom I would save, had a most noble father!\\nLet but your honour know,\\nWhom I believe to be most strait in virtue,\\nThat, in the working of your own affections,\\nHad time cohered with place or place with wishing,\\nOr that the resolute acting of your blood\\nCould have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,\\nWhether you had not sometime in your life\\nErr'd in this point which now you censure him,\\nAnd pull'd the law upon you.\\n\\nANGELO:\\n'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,\\nAnother thing to fall. I not deny,\\nThe jury, passing on the prisoner's life,\\nMay in the sworn twelve have a thief or two\\nGuiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,\\nThat justice seizes: what know the laws\\nThat thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,\\nThe jewel that we find, we stoop and take't\\nBecause we see it; but what we do not see\\nWe tread upon, and never think of it.\\nYou may not so extenuate his offence\\nFor I have had such faults; but rather tell me,\\nWhen I, that censure him, do so offend,\\nLet mine own judgment pattern out my death,\\nAnd nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nBe it as your wisdom will.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhere is the provost?\\n\\nProvost:\\nHere, if it like your honour.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nSee that Claudio\\nBe executed by nine to-morrow morning:\\nBring him his confessor, let him be prepared;\\nFor that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\n\\nELBOW:\\nCome, bring them away: if these be good people in\\na commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in\\ncommon houses, I know no law: bring them away.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHow now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nIf it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's\\nconstable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon\\njustice, sir, and do bring in here before your good\\nhonour two notorious benefactors.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nBenefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are\\nthey not malefactors?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nIf it? please your honour, I know not well what they\\nare: but precise villains they are, that I am sure\\nof; and void of all profanation in the world that\\ngood Christians ought to have.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nThis comes off well; here's a wise officer.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nGo to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your\\nname? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nHe cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhat are you, sir?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nHe, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that\\nserves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they\\nsay, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she\\nprofesses a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHow know you that?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nMy wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHow? thy wife?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nAy, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nDost thou detest her therefore?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nI say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as\\nshe, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,\\nit is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHow dost thou know that, constable?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nMarry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman\\ncardinally given, might have been accused in\\nfornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nBy the woman's means?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nAy, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she\\nspit in his face, so she defied him.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, if it please your honour, this is not so.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nProve it before these varlets here, thou honourable\\nman; prove it.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nDo you hear how he misplaces?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, she came in great with child; and longing,\\nsaving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;\\nsir, we had but two in the house, which at that very\\ndistant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a\\ndish of some three-pence; your honours have seen\\nsuch dishes; they are not China dishes, but very\\ngood dishes,--\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nGo to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nNo, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in\\nthe right: but to the point. As I say, this\\nMistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and\\nbeing great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for\\nprunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,\\nMaster Froth here, this very man, having eaten the\\nrest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very\\nhonestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could\\nnot give you three-pence again.\\n\\nFROTH:\\nNo, indeed.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nVery well: you being then, if you be remembered,\\ncracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--\\n\\nFROTH:\\nAy, so I did indeed.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nWhy, very well; I telling you then, if you be\\nremembered, that such a one and such a one were past\\ncure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very\\ngood diet, as I told you,--\\n\\nFROTH:\\nAll this is true.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nWhy, very well, then,--\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nCome, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What\\nwas done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to\\ncomplain of? Come me to what was done to her.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, your honour cannot come to that yet.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nNo, sir, nor I mean it not.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's\\nleave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth\\nhere, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose\\nfather died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,\\nMaster Froth?\\n\\nFROTH:\\nAll-hallond eve.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nWhy, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,\\nsitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in\\nthe Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight\\nto sit, have you not?\\n\\nFROTH:\\nI have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nWhy, very well, then; I hope here be truths.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThis will last out a night in Russia,\\nWhen nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.\\nAnd leave you to the hearing of the cause;\\nHoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.\\nNow, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nOnce, sir? there was nothing done to her once.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nI beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI beseech your honour, ask me.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWell, sir; what did this gentleman to her?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.\\nGood Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a\\ngood purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nAy, sir, very well.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nNay; I beseech you, mark it well.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWell, I do so.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nDoth your honour see any harm in his face?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhy, no.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst\\nthing about him. Good, then; if his face be the\\nworst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the\\nconstable's wife any harm? I would know that of\\nyour honour.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHe's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nFirst, an it like you, the house is a respected\\nhouse; next, this is a respected fellow; and his\\nmistress is a respected woman.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nBy this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected\\nperson than any of us all.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nVarlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the\\ntime has yet to come that she was ever respected\\nwith man, woman, or child.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, she was respected with him before he married with her.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhich is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is\\nthis true?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nO thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked\\nHannibal! I respected with her before I was married\\nto her! If ever I was respected with her, or she\\nwith me, let not your worship think me the poor\\nduke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or\\nI'll have mine action of battery on thee.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nIf he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your\\naction of slander too.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nMarry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't\\nyour worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nTruly, officer, because he hath some offences in him\\nthat thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him\\ncontinue in his courses till thou knowest what they\\nare.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nMarry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou\\nwicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art\\nto continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhere were you born, friend?\\n\\nFROTH:\\nHere in Vienna, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nAre you of fourscore pounds a year?\\n\\nFROTH:\\nYes, an't please you, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nSo. What trade are you of, sir?\\n\\nPOMPHEY:\\nTapster; a poor widow's tapster.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nYour mistress' name?\\n\\nPOMPHEY:\\nMistress Overdone.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHath she had any more than one husband?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nNine, sir; Overdone by the last.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nNine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master\\nFroth, I would not have you acquainted with\\ntapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you\\nwill hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no\\nmore of you.\\n\\nFROTH:\\nI thank your worship. For mine own part, I never\\ncome into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn\\nin.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWell, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.\\nCome you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your\\nname, Master tapster?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nPompey.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhat else?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nBum, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nTroth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;\\nso that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the\\nGreat. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,\\nhowsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you\\nnot? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nTruly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHow would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What\\ndo you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nIf the law would allow it, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nBut the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall\\nnot be allowed in Vienna.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nDoes your worship mean to geld and splay all the\\nyouth of the city?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nNo, Pompey.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nTruly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.\\nIf your worship will take order for the drabs and\\nthe knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nThere are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:\\nit is but heading and hanging.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nIf you head and hang all that offend that way but\\nfor ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a\\ncommission for more heads: if this law hold in\\nVienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it\\nafter three-pence a bay: if you live to see this\\ncome to pass, say Pompey told you so.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nThank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your\\nprophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find\\nyou before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;\\nno, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,\\nI shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd\\nCaesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall\\nhave you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI thank your worship for your good counsel:\\nbut I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall\\nbetter determine.\\nWhip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:\\nThe valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nCome hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master\\nconstable. How long have you been in this place of constable?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nSeven year and a half, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI thought, by your readiness in the office, you had\\ncontinued in it some time. You say, seven years together?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nAnd a half, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nAlas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you\\nwrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men\\nin your ward sufficient to serve it?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nFaith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they\\nare chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I\\ndo it for some piece of money, and go through with\\nall.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nLook you bring me in the names of some six or seven,\\nthe most sufficient of your parish.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nTo your worship's house, sir?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nTo my house. Fare you well.\\nWhat's o'clock, think you?\\n\\nJustice:\\nEleven, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI pray you home to dinner with me.\\n\\nJustice:\\nI humbly thank you.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nIt grieves me for the death of Claudio;\\nBut there's no remedy.\\n\\nJustice:\\nLord Angelo is severe.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nIt is but needful:\\nMercy is not itself, that oft looks so;\\nPardon is still the nurse of second woe:\\nBut yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.\\nCome, sir.\\n\\nServant:\\nHe's hearing of a cause; he will come straight\\nI'll tell him of you.\\n\\nProvost:\\nPray you, do.\\nI'll know\\nHis pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,\\nHe hath but as offended in a dream!\\nAll sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he\\nTo die for't!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nNow, what's the matter. Provost?\\n\\nProvost:\\nIs it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nDid not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?\\nWhy dost thou ask again?\\n\\nProvost:\\nLest I might be too rash:\\nUnder your good correction, I have seen,\\nWhen, after execution, judgment hath\\nRepented o'er his doom.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nGo to; let that be mine:\\nDo you your office, or give up your place,\\nAnd you shall well be spared.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI crave your honour's pardon.\\nWhat shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?\\nShe's very near her hour.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nDispose of her\\nTo some more fitter place, and that with speed.\\n\\nServant:\\nHere is the sister of the man condemn'd\\nDesires access to you.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHath he a sister?\\n\\nProvost:\\nAy, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,\\nAnd to be shortly of a sisterhood,\\nIf not already.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWell, let her be admitted.\\nSee you the fornicatress be removed:\\nLet have needful, but not lavish, means;\\nThere shall be order for't.\\n\\nProvost:\\nGod save your honour!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nStay a little while.\\nYou're welcome: what's your will?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI am a woeful suitor to your honour,\\nPlease but your honour hear me.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWell; what's your suit?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThere is a vice that most I do abhor,\\nAnd most desire should meet the blow of justice;\\nFor which I would not plead, but that I must;\\nFor which I must not plead, but that I am\\nAt war 'twixt will and will not.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWell; the matter?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI have a brother is condemn'd to die:\\nI do beseech you, let it be his fault,\\nAnd not my brother.\\n\\nProvost:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nCondemn the fault and not the actor of it?\\nWhy, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:\\nMine were the very cipher of a function,\\nTo fine the faults whose fine stands in record,\\nAnd let go by the actor.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO just but severe law!\\nI had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nMust he needs die?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nMaiden, no remedy.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYes; I do think that you might pardon him,\\nAnd neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI will not do't.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBut can you, if you would?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nLook, what I will not, that I cannot do.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBut might you do't, and do the world no wrong,\\nIf so your heart were touch'd with that remorse\\nAs mine is to him?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHe's sentenced; 'tis too late.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nToo late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.\\nMay call it back again. Well, believe this,\\nNo ceremony that to great ones 'longs,\\nNot the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,\\nThe marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,\\nBecome them with one half so good a grace\\nAs mercy does.\\nIf he had been as you and you as he,\\nYou would have slipt like him; but he, like you,\\nWould not have been so stern.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nPray you, be gone.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI would to heaven I had your potency,\\nAnd you were Isabel! should it then be thus?\\nNo; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,\\nAnd what a prisoner.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nYour brother is a forfeit of the law,\\nAnd you but waste your words.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAlas, alas!\\nWhy, all the souls that were were forfeit once;\\nAnd He that might the vantage best have took\\nFound out the remedy. How would you be,\\nIf He, which is the top of judgment, should\\nBut judge you as you are? O, think on that;\\nAnd mercy then will breathe within your lips,\\nLike man new made.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nBe you content, fair maid;\\nIt is the law, not I condemn your brother:\\nWere he my kinsman, brother, or my son,\\nIt should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nTo-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!\\nHe's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens\\nWe kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven\\nWith less respect than we do minister\\nTo our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;\\nWho is it that hath died for this offence?\\nThere's many have committed it.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThe law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:\\nThose many had not dared to do that evil,\\nIf the first that did the edict infringe\\nHad answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake\\nTakes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,\\nLooks in a glass, that shows what future evils,\\nEither new, or by remissness new-conceived,\\nAnd so in progress to be hatch'd and born,\\nAre now to have no successive degrees,\\nBut, ere they live, to end.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYet show some pity.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI show it most of all when I show justice;\\nFor then I pity those I do not know,\\nWhich a dismiss'd offence would after gall;\\nAnd do him right that, answering one foul wrong,\\nLives not to act another. Be satisfied;\\nYour brother dies to-morrow; be content.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nSo you must be the first that gives this sentence,\\nAnd he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent\\nTo have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous\\nTo use it like a giant.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nCould great men thunder\\nAs Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,\\nFor every pelting, petty officer\\nWould use his heaven for thunder;\\nNothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,\\nThou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt\\nSplit'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak\\nThan the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,\\nDrest in a little brief authority,\\nMost ignorant of what he's most assured,\\nHis glassy essence, like an angry ape,\\nPlays such fantastic tricks before high heaven\\nAs make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,\\nWould all themselves laugh mortal.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nProvost:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWe cannot weigh our brother with ourself:\\nGreat men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,\\nBut in the less foul profanation.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThat in the captain's but a choleric word,\\nWhich in the soldier is flat blasphemy.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhy do you put these sayings upon me?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBecause authority, though it err like others,\\nHath yet a kind of medicine in itself,\\nThat skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;\\nKnock there, and ask your heart what it doth know\\nThat's like my brother's fault: if it confess\\nA natural guiltiness such as is his,\\nLet it not sound a thought upon your tongue\\nAgainst my brother's life.\\n\\nANGELO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nGentle my lord, turn back.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI will bethink me: come again tomorrow.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHow! bribe me?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAy, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nNot with fond shekels of the tested gold,\\nOr stones whose rates are either rich or poor\\nAs fancy values them; but with true prayers\\nThat shall be up at heaven and enter there\\nEre sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,\\nFrom fasting maids whose minds are dedicate\\nTo nothing temporal.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWell; come to me to-morrow.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHeaven keep your honour safe!\\n\\nANGELO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAt what hour to-morrow\\nShall I attend your lordship?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAt any time 'fore noon.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\n'Save your honour!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nFrom thee, even from thy virtue!\\nWhat's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?\\nThe tempter or the tempted, who sins most?\\nHa!\\nNot she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I\\nThat, lying by the violet in the sun,\\nDo as the carrion does, not as the flower,\\nCorrupt with virtuous season. Can it be\\nThat modesty may more betray our sense\\nThan woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,\\nShall we desire to raze the sanctuary\\nAnd pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!\\nWhat dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?\\nDost thou desire her foully for those things\\nThat make her good? O, let her brother live!\\nThieves for their robbery have authority\\nWhen judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,\\nThat I desire to hear her speak again,\\nAnd feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?\\nO cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,\\nWith saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous\\nIs that temptation that doth goad us on\\nTo sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,\\nWith all her double vigour, art and nature,\\nOnce stir my temper; but this virtuous maid\\nSubdues me quite. Even till now,\\nWhen men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHail to you, provost! so I think you are.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI am the provost. What's your will, good friar?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBound by my charity and my blest order,\\nI come to visit the afflicted spirits\\nHere in the prison. Do me the common right\\nTo let me see them and to make me know\\nThe nature of their crimes, that I may minister\\nTo them accordingly.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI would do more than that, if more were needful.\\nLook, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,\\nWho, falling in the flaws of her own youth,\\nHath blister'd her report: she is with child;\\nAnd he that got it, sentenced; a young man\\nMore fit to do another such offence\\nThan die for this.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhen must he die?\\n\\nProvost:\\nAs I do think, to-morrow.\\nI have provided for you: stay awhile,\\nAnd you shall be conducted.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nRepent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?\\n\\nJULIET:\\nI do; and bear the shame most patiently.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,\\nAnd try your penitence, if it be sound,\\nOr hollowly put on.\\n\\nJULIET:\\nI'll gladly learn.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nLove you the man that wrong'd you?\\n\\nJULIET:\\nYes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSo then it seems your most offenceful act\\nWas mutually committed?\\n\\nJULIET:\\nMutually.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThen was your sin of heavier kind than his.\\n\\nJULIET:\\nI do confess it, and repent it, father.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,\\nAs that the sin hath brought you to this shame,\\nWhich sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,\\nShowing we would not spare heaven as we love it,\\nBut as we stand in fear,--\\n\\nJULIET:\\nI do repent me, as it is an evil,\\nAnd take the shame with joy.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThere rest.\\nYour partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,\\nAnd I am going with instruction to him.\\nGrace go with you, Benedicite!\\n\\nJULIET:\\nMust die to-morrow! O injurious love,\\nThat respites me a life, whose very comfort\\nIs still a dying horror!\\n\\nProvost:\\n'Tis pity of him.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhen I would pray and think, I think and pray\\nTo several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;\\nWhilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,\\nAnchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,\\nAs if I did but only chew his name;\\nAnd in my heart the strong and swelling evil\\nOf my conception. The state, whereon I studied\\nIs like a good thing, being often read,\\nGrown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,\\nWherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,\\nCould I with boot change for an idle plume,\\nWhich the air beats for vain. O place, O form,\\nHow often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,\\nWrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls\\nTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:\\nLet's write good angel on the devil's horn:\\n'Tis not the devil's crest.\\nHow now! who's there?\\n\\nServant:\\nOne Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nTeach her the way.\\nO heavens!\\nWhy does my blood thus muster to my heart,\\nMaking both it unable for itself,\\nAnd dispossessing all my other parts\\nOf necessary fitness?\\nSo play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;\\nCome all to help him, and so stop the air\\nBy which he should revive: and even so\\nThe general, subject to a well-wish'd king,\\nQuit their own part, and in obsequious fondness\\nCrowd to his presence, where their untaught love\\nMust needs appear offence.\\nHow now, fair maid?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI am come to know your pleasure.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThat you might know it, would much better please me\\nThan to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nEven so. Heaven keep your honour!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nYet may he live awhile; and, it may be,\\nAs long as you or I yet he must die.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nUnder your sentence?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nYea.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhen, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,\\nLonger or shorter, he may be so fitted\\nThat his soul sicken not.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHa! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good\\nTo pardon him that hath from nature stolen\\nA man already made, as to remit\\nTheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image\\nIn stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy\\nFalsely to take away a life true made\\nAs to put metal in restrained means\\nTo make a false one.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\n'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nSay you so? then I shall pose you quickly.\\nWhich had you rather, that the most just law\\nNow took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,\\nGive up your body to such sweet uncleanness\\nAs she that he hath stain'd?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nSir, believe this,\\nI had rather give my body than my soul.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins\\nStand more for number than for accompt.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHow say you?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nNay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak\\nAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:\\nI, now the voice of the recorded law,\\nPronounce a sentence on your brother's life:\\nMight there not be a charity in sin\\nTo save this brother's life?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nPlease you to do't,\\nI'll take it as a peril to my soul,\\nIt is no sin at all, but charity.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nPleased you to do't at peril of your soul,\\nWere equal poise of sin and charity.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThat I do beg his life, if it be sin,\\nHeaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,\\nIf that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer\\nTo have it added to the faults of mine,\\nAnd nothing of your answer.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nNay, but hear me.\\nYour sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,\\nOr seem so craftily; and that's not good.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nLet me be ignorant, and in nothing good,\\nBut graciously to know I am no better.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThus wisdom wishes to appear most bright\\nWhen it doth tax itself; as these black masks\\nProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder\\nThan beauty could, display'd. But mark me;\\nTo be received plain, I'll speak more gross:\\nYour brother is to die.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nSo.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAnd his offence is so, as it appears,\\nAccountant to the law upon that pain.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nTrue.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAdmit no other way to save his life,--\\nAs I subscribe not that, nor any other,\\nBut in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,\\nFinding yourself desired of such a person,\\nWhose credit with the judge, or own great place,\\nCould fetch your brother from the manacles\\nOf the all-building law; and that there were\\nNo earthly mean to save him, but that either\\nYou must lay down the treasures of your body\\nTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer;\\nWhat would you do?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAs much for my poor brother as myself:\\nThat is, were I under the terms of death,\\nThe impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,\\nAnd strip myself to death, as to a bed\\nThat longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield\\nMy body up to shame.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThen must your brother die.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAnd 'twere the cheaper way:\\nBetter it were a brother died at once,\\nThan that a sister, by redeeming him,\\nShould die for ever.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWere not you then as cruel as the sentence\\nThat you have slander'd so?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nIgnomy in ransom and free pardon\\nAre of two houses: lawful mercy\\nIs nothing kin to foul redemption.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nYou seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;\\nAnd rather proved the sliding of your brother\\nA merriment than a vice.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,\\nTo have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:\\nI something do excuse the thing I hate,\\nFor his advantage that I dearly love.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWe are all frail.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nElse let my brother die,\\nIf not a feodary, but only he\\nOwe and succeed thy weakness.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nNay, women are frail too.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAy, as the glasses where they view themselves;\\nWhich are as easy broke as they make forms.\\nWomen! Help Heaven! men their creation mar\\nIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;\\nFor we are soft as our complexions are,\\nAnd credulous to false prints.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI think it well:\\nAnd from this testimony of your own sex,--\\nSince I suppose we are made to be no stronger\\nThan faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;\\nI do arrest your words. Be that you are,\\nThat is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;\\nIf you be one, as you are well express'd\\nBy all external warrants, show it now,\\nBy putting on the destined livery.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,\\nLet me entreat you speak the former language.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nPlainly conceive, I love you.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nMy brother did love Juliet,\\nAnd you tell me that he shall die for it.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHe shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI know your virtue hath a licence in't,\\nWhich seems a little fouler than it is,\\nTo pluck on others.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nBelieve me, on mine honour,\\nMy words express my purpose.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHa! little honour to be much believed,\\nAnd most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!\\nI will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:\\nSign me a present pardon for my brother,\\nOr with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud\\nWhat man thou art.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWho will believe thee, Isabel?\\nMy unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,\\nMy vouch against you, and my place i' the state,\\nWill so your accusation overweigh,\\nThat you shall stifle in your own report\\nAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,\\nAnd now I give my sensual race the rein:\\nFit thy consent to my sharp appetite;\\nLay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,\\nThat banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother\\nBy yielding up thy body to my will;\\nOr else he must not only die the death,\\nBut thy unkindness shall his death draw out\\nTo lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,\\nOr, by the affection that now guides me most,\\nI'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,\\nSay what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nTo whom should I complain? Did I tell this,\\nWho would believe me? O perilous mouths,\\nThat bear in them one and the self-same tongue,\\nEither of condemnation or approof;\\nBidding the law make court'sy to their will:\\nHooking both right and wrong to the appetite,\\nTo follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:\\nThough he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,\\nYet hath he in him such a mind of honour.\\nThat, had he twenty heads to tender down\\nOn twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,\\nBefore his sister should her body stoop\\nTo such abhorr'd pollution.\\nThen, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:\\nMore than our brother is our chastity.\\nI'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,\\nAnd fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSo then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThe miserable have no other medicine\\nBut only hope:\\nI've hope to live, and am prepared to die.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBe absolute for death; either death or life\\nShall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:\\nIf I do lose thee, I do lose a thing\\nThat none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,\\nServile to all the skyey influences,\\nThat dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,\\nHourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;\\nFor him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun\\nAnd yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;\\nFor all the accommodations that thou bear'st\\nAre nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;\\nFor thou dost fear the soft and tender fork\\nOf a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,\\nAnd that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st\\nThy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;\\nFor thou exist'st on many a thousand grains\\nThat issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;\\nFor what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,\\nAnd what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;\\nFor thy complexion shifts to strange effects,\\nAfter the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;\\nFor, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,\\nThou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,\\nAnd death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;\\nFor thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,\\nThe mere effusion of thy proper loins,\\nDo curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,\\nFor ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,\\nBut, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,\\nDreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth\\nBecomes as aged, and doth beg the alms\\nOf palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,\\nThou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,\\nTo make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this\\nThat bears the name of life? Yet in this life\\nLie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,\\nThat makes these odds all even.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nI humbly thank you.\\nTo sue to live, I find I seek to die;\\nAnd, seeking death, find life: let it come on.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\n\\nProvost:\\nWho's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nDear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nMost holy sir, I thank you.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nMy business is a word or two with Claudio.\\n\\nProvost:\\nAnd very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nProvost, a word with you.\\n\\nProvost:\\nAs many as you please.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nNow, sister, what's the comfort?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhy,\\nAs all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.\\nLord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,\\nIntends you for his swift ambassador,\\nWhere you shall be an everlasting leiger:\\nTherefore your best appointment make with speed;\\nTo-morrow you set on.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nIs there no remedy?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nNone, but such remedy as, to save a head,\\nTo cleave a heart in twain.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nBut is there any?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYes, brother, you may live:\\nThere is a devilish mercy in the judge,\\nIf you'll implore it, that will free your life,\\nBut fetter you till death.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nPerpetual durance?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAy, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,\\nThough all the world's vastidity you had,\\nTo a determined scope.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nBut in what nature?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nIn such a one as, you consenting to't,\\nWould bark your honour from that trunk you bear,\\nAnd leave you naked.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nLet me know the point.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,\\nLest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,\\nAnd six or seven winters more respect\\nThan a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?\\nThe sense of death is most in apprehension;\\nAnd the poor beetle, that we tread upon,\\nIn corporal sufferance finds a pang as great\\nAs when a giant dies.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nWhy give you me this shame?\\nThink you I can a resolution fetch\\nFrom flowery tenderness? If I must die,\\nI will encounter darkness as a bride,\\nAnd hug it in mine arms.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThere spake my brother; there my father's grave\\nDid utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:\\nThou art too noble to conserve a life\\nIn base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,\\nWhose settled visage and deliberate word\\nNips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew\\nAs falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil\\nHis filth within being cast, he would appear\\nA pond as deep as hell.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThe prenzie Angelo!\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,\\nThe damned'st body to invest and cover\\nIn prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?\\nIf I would yield him my virginity,\\nThou mightst be freed.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nO heavens! it cannot be.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,\\nSo to offend him still. This night's the time\\nThat I should do what I abhor to name,\\nOr else thou diest to-morrow.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThou shalt not do't.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, were it but my life,\\nI'ld throw it down for your deliverance\\nAs frankly as a pin.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThanks, dear Isabel.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBe ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nYes. Has he affections in him,\\nThat thus can make him bite the law by the nose,\\nWhen he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,\\nOr of the deadly seven, it is the least.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhich is the least?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nIf it were damnable, he being so wise,\\nWhy would he for the momentary trick\\nBe perdurably fined? O Isabel!\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhat says my brother?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nDeath is a fearful thing.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAnd shamed life a hateful.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nAy, but to die, and go we know not where;\\nTo lie in cold obstruction and to rot;\\nThis sensible warm motion to become\\nA kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit\\nTo bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\\nIn thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;\\nTo be imprison'd in the viewless winds,\\nAnd blown with restless violence round about\\nThe pendent world; or to be worse than worst\\nOf those that lawless and incertain thought\\nImagine howling: 'tis too horrible!\\nThe weariest and most loathed worldly life\\nThat age, ache, penury and imprisonment\\nCan lay on nature is a paradise\\nTo what we fear of death.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAlas, alas!\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nSweet sister, let me live:\\nWhat sin you do to save a brother's life,\\nNature dispenses with the deed so far\\nThat it becomes a virtue.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO you beast!\\nO faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!\\nWilt thou be made a man out of my vice?\\nIs't not a kind of incest, to take life\\nFrom thine own sister's shame? What should I think?\\nHeaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!\\nFor such a warped slip of wilderness\\nNe'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!\\nDie, perish! Might but my bending down\\nReprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:\\nI'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,\\nNo word to save thee.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nNay, hear me, Isabel.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, fie, fie, fie!\\nThy sin's not accidental, but a trade.\\nMercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:\\n'Tis best thou diest quickly.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nO hear me, Isabella!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nVouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhat is your will?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMight you dispense with your leisure, I would by and\\nby have some speech with you: the satisfaction I\\nwould require is likewise your own benefit.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be\\nstolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSon, I have overheard what hath passed between you\\nand your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to\\ncorrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her\\nvirtue to practise his judgment with the disposition\\nof natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,\\nhath made him that gracious denial which he is most\\nglad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I\\nknow this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to\\ndeath: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes\\nthat are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to\\nyour knees and make ready.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nLet me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love\\nwith life that I will sue to be rid of it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHold you there: farewell.\\nProvost, a word with you!\\n\\nProvost:\\nWhat's your will, father\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThat now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me\\nawhile with the maid: my mind promises with my\\nhabit no loss shall touch her by my company.\\n\\nProvost:\\nIn good time.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThe hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:\\nthe goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty\\nbrief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of\\nyour complexion, shall keep the body of it ever\\nfair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,\\nfortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but\\nthat frailty hath examples for his falling, I should\\nwonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this\\nsubstitute, and to save your brother?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI am now going to resolve him: I had rather my\\nbrother die by the law than my son should be\\nunlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke\\ndeceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can\\nspeak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or\\ndiscover his government.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThat shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter\\nnow stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made\\ntrial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my\\nadvisings: to the love I have in doing good a\\nremedy presents itself. I do make myself believe\\nthat you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged\\nlady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from\\nthe angry law; do no stain to your own gracious\\nperson; and much please the absent duke, if\\nperadventure he shall ever return to have hearing of\\nthis business.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nLet me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do\\nanything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nVirtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have\\nyou not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of\\nFrederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nShe should this Angelo have married; was affianced\\nto her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between\\nwhich time of the contract and limit of the\\nsolemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,\\nhaving in that perished vessel the dowry of his\\nsister. But mark how heavily this befell to the\\npoor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and\\nrenowned brother, in his love toward her ever most\\nkind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of\\nher fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her\\ncombinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nCan this be so? did Angelo so leave her?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nLeft her in her tears, and dried not one of them\\nwith his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,\\npretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,\\nbestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet\\nwears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,\\nis washed with them, but relents not.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maid\\nfrom the world! What corruption in this life, that\\nit will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the\\ncure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps\\nyou from dishonour in doing it.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nShow me how, good father.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThis forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance\\nof her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that\\nin all reason should have quenched her love, hath,\\nlike an impediment in the current, made it more\\nviolent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his\\nrequiring with a plausible obedience; agree with\\nhis demands to the point; only refer yourself to\\nthis advantage, first, that your stay with him may\\nnot be long; that the time may have all shadow and\\nsilence in it; and the place answer to convenience.\\nThis being granted in course,--and now follows\\nall,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up\\nyour appointment, go in your place; if the encounter\\nacknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to\\nher recompense: and here, by this, is your brother\\nsaved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana\\nadvantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid\\nwill I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you\\nthink well to carry this as you may, the doubleness\\nof the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.\\nWhat think you of it?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThe image of it gives me content already; and I\\ntrust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily\\nto Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his\\nbed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will\\npresently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated\\ngrange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that\\nplace call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that\\nit may be quickly.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nNay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will\\nneeds buy and sell men and women like beasts, we\\nshall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO heavens! what stuff is here\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\n'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the\\nmerriest was put down, and the worser allowed by\\norder of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and\\nfurred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that\\ncraft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nCome your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAnd you, good brother father. What offence hath\\nthis man made you, sir?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nMarry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we\\ntake him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found\\nupon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have\\nsent to the deputy.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nFie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!\\nThe evil that thou causest to be done,\\nThat is thy means to live. Do thou but think\\nWhat 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back\\nFrom such a filthy vice: say to thyself,\\nFrom their abominable and beastly touches\\nI drink, I eat, array myself, and live.\\nCanst thou believe thy living is a life,\\nSo stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nIndeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,\\nsir, I would prove--\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,\\nThou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:\\nCorrection and instruction must both work\\nEre this rude beast will profit.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nHe must before the deputy, sir; he has given him\\nwarning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if\\nhe be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were\\nas good go a mile on his errand.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThat we were all, as some would seem to be,\\nFrom our faults, as faults from seeming, free!\\n\\nELBOW:\\nHis neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a\\nfriend of mine.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nHow now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of\\nCaesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there\\nnone of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be\\nhad now, for putting the hand in the pocket and\\nextracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What\\nsayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't\\nnot drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest\\nthou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is\\nthe way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The\\ntrick of it?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nStill thus, and thus; still worse!\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nHow doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she\\nstill, ha?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nTroth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she\\nis herself in the tub.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhy, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be\\nso: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:\\nan unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going\\nto prison, Pompey?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nYes, faith, sir.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhy, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I\\nsent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nFor being a bawd, for being a bawd.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWell, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the\\ndue of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he\\ndoubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.\\nFarewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,\\nPompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you\\nwill keep the house.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNo, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.\\nI will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If\\nyou take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the\\nmore. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAnd you.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nDoes Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nCome your ways, sir; come.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nYou will not bail me, then, sir?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThen, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?\\nwhat news?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nCome your ways, sir; come.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nGo to kennel, Pompey; go.\\nWhat news, friar, of the duke?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI know none. Can you tell me of any?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nSome say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other\\nsome, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIt was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from\\nthe state, and usurp the beggary he was never born\\nto. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he\\nputs transgression to 't.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHe does well in 't.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nA little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in\\nhim: something too crabbed that way, friar.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nYes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;\\nit is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp\\nit quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put\\ndown. They say this Angelo was not made by man and\\nwoman after this downright way of creation: is it\\ntrue, think you?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHow should he be made, then?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nSome report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he\\nwas begot between two stock-fishes. But it is\\ncertain that when he makes water his urine is\\ncongealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a\\nmotion generative; that's infallible.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhy, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the\\nrebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a\\nman! Would the duke that is absent have done this?\\nEre he would have hanged a man for the getting a\\nhundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing\\na thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he\\nknew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI never heard the absent duke much detected for\\nwomen; he was not inclined that way.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nO, sir, you are deceived.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n'Tis not possible.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWho, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and\\nhis use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the\\nduke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;\\nthat let me inform you.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou do him wrong, surely.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nSir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the\\nduke: and I believe I know the cause of his\\nwithdrawing.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhat, I prithee, might be the cause?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNo, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the\\nteeth and the lips: but this I can let you\\nunderstand, the greater file of the subject held the\\nduke to be wise.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWise! why, no question but he was.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nA very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nEither this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:\\nthe very stream of his life and the business he hath\\nhelmed must upon a warranted need give him a better\\nproclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own\\nbringings-forth, and he shall appear to the\\nenvious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.\\nTherefore you speak unskilfully: or if your\\nknowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nSir, I know him, and I love him.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nLove talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with\\ndearer love.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nCome, sir, I know what I know.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI can hardly believe that, since you know not what\\nyou speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our\\nprayers are he may, let me desire you to make your\\nanswer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,\\nyou have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call\\nupon you; and, I pray you, your name?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nSir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHe shall know you better, sir, if I may live to\\nreport you.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI fear you not.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO, you hope the duke will return no more; or you\\nimagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I\\ncan do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,\\nfriar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if\\nClaudio die to-morrow or no?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhy should he die, sir?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhy? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would\\nthe duke we talk of were returned again: the\\nungenitured agent will unpeople the province with\\ncontinency; sparrows must not build in his\\nhouse-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke\\nyet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would\\nnever bring them to light: would he were returned!\\nMarry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.\\nFarewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The\\nduke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on\\nFridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,\\nhe would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown\\nbread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNo might nor greatness in mortality\\nCan censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny\\nThe whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong\\nCan tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?\\nBut who comes here?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nGo; away with her to prison!\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nGood my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted\\na merciful man; good my lord.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nDouble and treble admonition, and still forfeit in\\nthe same kind! This would make mercy swear and play\\nthe tyrant.\\n\\nProvost:\\nA bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please\\nyour honour.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nMy lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.\\nMistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the\\nduke's time; he promised her marriage: his child\\nis a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:\\nI have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nThat fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be\\ncalled before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;\\nno more words.\\nProvost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;\\nClaudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished\\nwith divines, and have all charitable preparation.\\nif my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be\\nso with him.\\n\\nProvost:\\nSo please you, this friar hath been with him, and\\nadvised him for the entertainment of death.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nGood even, good father.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBliss and goodness on you!\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nOf whence are you?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNot of this country, though my chance is now\\nTo use it for my time: I am a brother\\nOf gracious order, late come from the See\\nIn special business from his holiness.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhat news abroad i' the world?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNone, but that there is so great a fever on\\ngoodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:\\nnovelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous\\nto be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous\\nto be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce\\ntruth enough alive to make societies secure; but\\nsecurity enough to make fellowships accurst: much\\nupon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This\\nnews is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I\\npray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nOne that, above all other strifes, contended\\nespecially to know himself.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhat pleasure was he given to?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nRather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at\\nany thing which professed to make him rejoice: a\\ngentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to\\nhis events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;\\nand let me desire to know how you find Claudio\\nprepared. I am made to understand that you have\\nlent him visitation.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHe professes to have received no sinister measure\\nfrom his judge, but most willingly humbles himself\\nto the determination of justice: yet had he framed\\nto himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many\\ndeceiving promises of life; which I by my good\\nleisure have discredited to him, and now is he\\nresolved to die.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nYou have paid the heavens your function, and the\\nprisoner the very debt of your calling. I have\\nlaboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest\\nshore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I\\nfound so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him\\nhe is indeed Justice.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIf his own life answer the straitness of his\\nproceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he\\nchance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nPeace be with you!\\nHe who the sword of heaven will bear\\nShould be as holy as severe;\\nPattern in himself to know,\\nGrace to stand, and virtue go;\\nMore nor less to others paying\\nThan by self-offences weighing.\\nShame to him whose cruel striking\\nKills for faults of his own liking!\\nTwice treble shame on Angelo,\\nTo weed my vice and let his grow!\\nO, what may man within him hide,\\nThough angel on the outward side!\\nHow may likeness made in crimes,\\nMaking practise on the times,\\nTo draw with idle spiders' strings\\nMost ponderous and substantial things!\\nCraft against vice I must apply:\\nWith Angelo to-night shall lie\\nHis old betrothed but despised;\\nSo disguise shall, by the disguised,\\nPay with falsehood false exacting,\\nAnd perform an old contracting.\\n\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nBreak off thy song, and haste thee quick away:\\nHere comes a man of comfort, whose advice\\nHath often still'd my brawling discontent.\\nI cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish\\nYou had not found me here so musical:\\nLet me excuse me, and believe me so,\\nMy mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm\\nTo make bad good, and good provoke to harm.\\nI pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired\\nfor me here to-day? much upon this time have\\nI promised here to meet.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nYou have not been inquired after:\\nI have sat here all day.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI do constantly believe you. The time is come even\\nnow. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may\\nbe I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nI am always bound to you.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nVery well met, and well come.\\nWhat is the news from this good deputy?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHe hath a garden circummured with brick,\\nWhose western side is with a vineyard back'd;\\nAnd to that vineyard is a planched gate,\\nThat makes his opening with this bigger key:\\nThis other doth command a little door\\nWhich from the vineyard to the garden leads;\\nThere have I made my promise\\nUpon the heavy middle of the night\\nTo call upon him.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBut shall you on your knowledge find this way?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:\\nWith whispering and most guilty diligence,\\nIn action all of precept, he did show me\\nThe way twice o'er.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAre there no other tokens\\nBetween you 'greed concerning her observance?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nNo, none, but only a repair i' the dark;\\nAnd that I have possess'd him my most stay\\nCan be but brief; for I have made him know\\nI have a servant comes with me along,\\nThat stays upon me, whose persuasion is\\nI come about my brother.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n'Tis well borne up.\\nI have not yet made known to Mariana\\nA word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!\\nI pray you, be acquainted with this maid;\\nShe comes to do you good.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI do desire the like.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nDo you persuade yourself that I respect you?\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nGood friar, I know you do, and have found it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nTake, then, this your companion by the hand,\\nWho hath a story ready for your ear.\\nI shall attend your leisure: but make haste;\\nThe vaporous night approaches.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nWill't please you walk aside?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO place and greatness! millions of false eyes\\nAre stuck upon thee: volumes of report\\nRun with these false and most contrarious quests\\nUpon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit\\nMake thee the father of their idle dreams\\nAnd rack thee in their fancies.\\nWelcome, how agreed?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nShe'll take the enterprise upon her, father,\\nIf you advise it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is not my consent,\\nBut my entreaty too.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nLittle have you to say\\nWhen you depart from him, but, soft and low,\\n'Remember now my brother.'\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nFear me not.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.\\nHe is your husband on a pre-contract:\\nTo bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,\\nSith that the justice of your title to him\\nDoth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:\\nOur corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.\\n\\nProvost:\\nCome hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nIf the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a\\nmarried man, he's his wife's head, and I can never\\ncut off a woman's head.\\n\\nProvost:\\nCome, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a\\ndirect answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio\\nand Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common\\nexecutioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if\\nyou will take it on you to assist him, it shall\\nredeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have\\nyour full time of imprisonment and your deliverance\\nwith an unpitied whipping, for you have been a\\nnotorious bawd.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;\\nbut yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I\\nwould be glad to receive some instruction from my\\nfellow partner.\\n\\nProvost:\\nWhat, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nDo you call, sir?\\n\\nProvost:\\nSirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in\\nyour execution. If you think it meet, compound with\\nhim by the year, and let him abide here with you; if\\nnot, use him for the present and dismiss him. He\\ncannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nA bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.\\n\\nProvost:\\nGo to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn\\nthe scale.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nPray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a\\ngood favour you have, but that you have a hanging\\nlook,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nAy, sir; a mystery\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nPainting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and\\nyour whores, sir, being members of my occupation,\\nusing painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:\\nbut what mystery there should be in hanging, if I\\nshould be hanged, I cannot imagine.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nSir, it is a mystery.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nProof?\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nEvery true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be\\ntoo little for your thief, your true man thinks it\\nbig enough; if it be too big for your thief, your\\nthief thinks it little enough: so every true man's\\napparel fits your thief.\\n\\nProvost:\\nAre you agreed?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is\\na more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth\\noftener ask forgiveness.\\n\\nProvost:\\nYou, sirrah, provide your block and your axe\\nto-morrow four o'clock.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nCome on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have\\noccasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find\\nme yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you\\na good turn.\\n\\nProvost:\\nCall hither Barnardine and Claudio:\\nThe one has my pity; not a jot the other,\\nBeing a murderer, though he were my brother.\\nLook, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:\\n'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow\\nThou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nAs fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour\\nWhen it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:\\nHe will not wake.\\n\\nProvost:\\nWho can do good on him?\\nWell, go, prepare yourself.\\nBut, hark, what noise?\\nHeaven give your spirits comfort!\\nBy and by.\\nI hope it is some pardon or reprieve\\nFor the most gentle Claudio.\\nWelcome father.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThe best and wholesomest spirts of the night\\nEnvelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?\\n\\nProvost:\\nNone, since the curfew rung.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNot Isabel?\\n\\nProvost:\\nNo.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThey will, then, ere't be long.\\n\\nProvost:\\nWhat comfort is for Claudio?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThere's some in hope.\\n\\nProvost:\\nIt is a bitter deputy.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNot so, not so; his life is parallel'd\\nEven with the stroke and line of his great justice:\\nHe doth with holy abstinence subdue\\nThat in himself which he spurs on his power\\nTo qualify in others: were he meal'd with that\\nWhich he corrects, then were he tyrannous;\\nBut this being so, he's just.\\nNow are they come.\\nThis is a gentle provost: seldom when\\nThe steeled gaoler is the friend of men.\\nHow now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste\\nThat wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.\\n\\nProvost:\\nThere he must stay until the officer\\nArise to let him in: he is call'd up.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHave you no countermand for Claudio yet,\\nBut he must die to-morrow?\\n\\nProvost:\\nNone, sir, none.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAs near the dawning, provost, as it is,\\nYou shall hear more ere morning.\\n\\nProvost:\\nHappily\\nYou something know; yet I believe there comes\\nNo countermand; no such example have we:\\nBesides, upon the very siege of justice\\nLord Angelo hath to the public ear\\nProfess'd the contrary.\\nThis is his lordship's man.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAnd here comes Claudio's pardon.\\n\\nMessenger:\\n\\nProvost:\\nI shall obey him.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n\\nProvost:\\nI told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss\\nin mine office, awakens me with this unwonted\\nputting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nPray you, let's hear.\\n\\nProvost:\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhat is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the\\nafternoon?\\n\\nProvost:\\nA Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one\\nthat is a prisoner nine years old.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHow came it that the absent duke had not either\\ndelivered him to his liberty or executed him? I\\nhave heard it was ever his manner to do so.\\n\\nProvost:\\nHis friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,\\nindeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord\\nAngelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is now apparent?\\n\\nProvost:\\nMost manifest, and not denied by himself.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHath he born himself penitently in prison? how\\nseems he to be touched?\\n\\nProvost:\\nA man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but\\nas a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless\\nof what's past, present, or to come; insensible of\\nmortality, and desperately mortal.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHe wants advice.\\n\\nProvost:\\nHe will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty\\nof the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he\\nwould not: drunk many times a day, if not many days\\nentirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if\\nto carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming\\nwarrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMore of him anon. There is written in your brow,\\nprovost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not\\ntruly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the\\nboldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.\\nClaudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is\\nno greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath\\nsentenced him. To make you understand this in a\\nmanifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;\\nfor the which you are to do me both a present and a\\ndangerous courtesy.\\n\\nProvost:\\nPray, sir, in what?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIn the delaying death.\\n\\nProvost:\\nA lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,\\nand an express command, under penalty, to deliver\\nhis head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case\\nas Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBy the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my\\ninstructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine\\nbe this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.\\n\\nProvost:\\nAngelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.\\nShave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was\\nthe desire of the penitent to be so bared before his\\ndeath: you know the course is common. If any thing\\nfall to you upon this, more than thanks and good\\nfortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead\\nagainst it with my life.\\n\\nProvost:\\nPardon me, good father; it is against my oath.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWere you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?\\n\\nProvost:\\nTo him, and to his substitutes.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou will think you have made no offence, if the duke\\navouch the justice of your dealing?\\n\\nProvost:\\nBut what likelihood is in that?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNot a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see\\nyou fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor\\npersuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go\\nfurther than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.\\nLook you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the\\nduke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the\\nsignet is not strange to you.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI know them both.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThe contents of this is the return of the duke: you\\nshall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you\\nshall find, within these two days he will be here.\\nThis is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this\\nvery day receives letters of strange tenor;\\nperchance of the duke's death; perchance entering\\ninto some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what\\nis writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the\\nshepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these\\nthings should be: all difficulties are but easy\\nwhen they are known. Call your executioner, and off\\nwith Barnardine's head: I will give him a present\\nshrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you\\nare amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.\\nCome away; it is almost clear dawn.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI am as well acquainted here as I was in our house\\nof profession: one would think it were Mistress\\nOverdone's own house, for here be many of her old\\ncustomers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in\\nfor a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,\\nninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made\\nfive marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not\\nmuch in request, for the old women were all dead.\\nThen is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of\\nMaster Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of\\npeach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a\\nbeggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young\\nMaster Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master\\nStarve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young\\nDrop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master\\nForthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the\\ngreat traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed\\nPots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in\\nour trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nSirrah, bring Barnardine hither.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nMaster Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.\\nMaster Barnardine!\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nWhat, ho, Barnardine!\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nYour friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so\\ngood, sir, to rise and be put to death.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nTell him he must awake, and that quickly too.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nPray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are\\nexecuted, and sleep afterwards.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nGo in to him, and fetch him out.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nHe is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nIs the axe upon the block, sirrah?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nVery ready, sir.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\nHow now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nTruly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your\\nprayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\nYou rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not\\nfitted for 't.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nO, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,\\nand is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the\\nsounder all the next day.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nLook you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do\\nwe jest now, think you?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily\\nyou are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort\\nyou and pray with you.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\nFriar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,\\nand I will have more time to prepare me, or they\\nshall beat out my brains with billets: I will not\\nconsent to die this day, that's certain.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you\\nLook forward on the journey you shall go.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\nI swear I will not die to-day for any man's\\npersuasion.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBut hear you.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\nNot a word: if you have any thing to say to me,\\ncome to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nUnfit to live or die: O gravel heart!\\nAfter him, fellows; bring him to the block.\\n\\nProvost:\\nNow, sir, how do you find the prisoner?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nA creature unprepared, unmeet for death;\\nAnd to transport him in the mind he is\\nWere damnable.\\n\\nProvost:\\nHere in the prison, father,\\nThere died this morning of a cruel fever\\nOne Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,\\nA man of Claudio's years; his beard and head\\nJust of his colour. What if we do omit\\nThis reprobate till he were well inclined;\\nAnd satisfy the deputy with the visage\\nOf Ragozine, more like to Claudio?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!\\nDispatch it presently; the hour draws on\\nPrefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,\\nAnd sent according to command; whiles I\\nPersuade this rude wretch willingly to die.\\n\\nProvost:\\nThis shall be done, good father, presently.\\nBut Barnardine must die this afternoon:\\nAnd how shall we continue Claudio,\\nTo save me from the danger that might come\\nIf he were known alive?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nLet this be done.\\nPut them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:\\nEre twice the sun hath made his journal greeting\\nTo the under generation, you shall find\\nYour safety manifested.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI am your free dependant.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nQuick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.\\nNow will I write letters to Angelo,--\\nThe provost, he shall bear them, whose contents\\nShall witness to him I am near at home,\\nAnd that, by great injunctions, I am bound\\nTo enter publicly: him I'll desire\\nTo meet me at the consecrated fount\\nA league below the city; and from thence,\\nBy cold gradation and well-balanced form,\\nWe shall proceed with Angelo.\\n\\nProvost:\\nHere is the head; I'll carry it myself.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nConvenient is it. Make a swift return;\\nFor I would commune with you of such things\\nThat want no ear but yours.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI'll make all speed.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThe tongue of Isabel. She's come to know\\nIf yet her brother's pardon be come hither:\\nBut I will keep her ignorant of her good,\\nTo make her heavenly comforts of despair,\\nWhen it is least expected.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHo, by your leave!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nGood morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThe better, given me by so holy a man.\\nHath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHe hath released him, Isabel, from the world:\\nHis head is off and sent to Angelo.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nNay, but it is not so.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,\\nIn your close patience.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou shall not be admitted to his sight.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nUnhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!\\nInjurious world! most damned Angelo!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThis nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;\\nForbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.\\nMark what I say, which you shall find\\nBy every syllable a faithful verity:\\nThe duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;\\nOne of our convent, and his confessor,\\nGives me this instance: already he hath carried\\nNotice to Escalus and Angelo,\\nWho do prepare to meet him at the gates,\\nThere to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom\\nIn that good path that I would wish it go,\\nAnd you shall have your bosom on this wretch,\\nGrace of the duke, revenges to your heart,\\nAnd general honour.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI am directed by you.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThis letter, then, to Friar Peter give;\\n'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:\\nSay, by this token, I desire his company\\nAt Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours\\nI'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you\\nBefore the duke, and to the head of Angelo\\nAccuse him home and home. For my poor self,\\nI am combined by a sacred vow\\nAnd shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:\\nCommand these fretting waters from your eyes\\nWith a light heart; trust not my holy order,\\nIf I pervert your course. Who's here?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nGood even. Friar, where's the provost?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNot within, sir.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nO pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see\\nthine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain\\nto dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for\\nmy head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set\\nme to 't. But they say the duke will be here\\nto-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:\\nif the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been\\nat home, he had lived.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your\\nreports; but the best is, he lives not in them.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nFriar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:\\nhe's a better woodman than thou takest him for.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWell, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNay, tarry; I'll go along with thee\\nI can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou have told me too many of him already, sir, if\\nthey be true; if not true, none were enough.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI was once before him for getting a wench with child.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nDid you such a thing?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nYes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;\\nthey would else have married me to the rotten medlar.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBy my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:\\nif bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of\\nit. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nEvery letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nIn most uneven and distracted manner. His actions\\nshow much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be\\nnot tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and\\nredeliver our authorities there\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI guess not.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAnd why should we proclaim it in an hour before his\\nentering, that if any crave redress of injustice,\\nthey should exhibit their petitions in the street?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHe shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of\\ncomplaints, and to deliver us from devices\\nhereafter, which shall then have no power to stand\\nagainst us.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWell, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes\\ni' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give\\nnotice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet\\nhim.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI shall, sir. Fare you well.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nGood night.\\nThis deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant\\nAnd dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!\\nAnd by an eminent body that enforced\\nThe law against it! But that her tender shame\\nWill not proclaim against her maiden loss,\\nHow might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;\\nFor my authority bears of a credent bulk,\\nThat no particular scandal once can touch\\nBut it confounds the breather. He should have lived,\\nSave that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,\\nMight in the times to come have ta'en revenge,\\nBy so receiving a dishonour'd life\\nWith ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!\\nA lack, when once our grace we have forgot,\\nNothing goes right: we would, and we would not.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThese letters at fit time deliver me\\nThe provost knows our purpose and our plot.\\nThe matter being afoot, keep your instruction,\\nAnd hold you ever to our special drift;\\nThough sometimes you do blench from this to that,\\nAs cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,\\nAnd tell him where I stay: give the like notice\\nTo Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,\\nAnd bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;\\nBut send me Flavius first.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nIt shall be speeded well.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:\\nCome, we will walk. There's other of our friends\\nWill greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nTo speak so indirectly I am loath:\\nI would say the truth; but to accuse him so,\\nThat is your part: yet I am advised to do it;\\nHe says, to veil full purpose.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nBe ruled by him.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBesides, he tells me that, if peradventure\\nHe speak against me on the adverse side,\\nI should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic\\nThat's bitter to sweet end.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nI would Friar Peter--\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, peace! the friar is come.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nCome, I have found you out a stand most fit,\\nWhere you may have such vantage on the duke,\\nHe shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;\\nThe generous and gravest citizens\\nHave hent the gates, and very near upon\\nThe duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMy very worthy cousin, fairly met!\\nOur old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHappy return be to your royal grace!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMany and hearty thankings to you both.\\nWe have made inquiry of you; and we hear\\nSuch goodness of your justice, that our soul\\nCannot but yield you forth to public thanks,\\nForerunning more requital.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nYou make my bonds still greater.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,\\nTo lock it in the wards of covert bosom,\\nWhen it deserves, with characters of brass,\\nA forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time\\nAnd razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,\\nAnd let the subject see, to make them know\\nThat outward courtesies would fain proclaim\\nFavours that keep within. Come, Escalus,\\nYou must walk by us on our other hand;\\nAnd good supporters are you.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nNow is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nJustice, O royal duke! Vail your regard\\nUpon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!\\nO worthy prince, dishonour not your eye\\nBy throwing it on any other object\\nTill you have heard me in my true complaint\\nAnd given me justice, justice, justice, justice!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nRelate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.\\nHere is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:\\nReveal yourself to him.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO worthy duke,\\nYou bid me seek redemption of the devil:\\nHear me yourself; for that which I must speak\\nMust either punish me, not being believed,\\nOr wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nMy lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:\\nShe hath been a suitor to me for her brother\\nCut off by course of justice,--\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBy course of justice!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAnd she will speak most bitterly and strange.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nMost strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:\\nThat Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?\\nThat Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?\\nThat Angelo is an adulterous thief,\\nAn hypocrite, a virgin-violator;\\nIs it not strange and strange?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNay, it is ten times strange.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nIt is not truer he is Angelo\\nThan this is all as true as it is strange:\\nNay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth\\nTo the end of reckoning.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAway with her! Poor soul,\\nShe speaks this in the infirmity of sense.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest\\nThere is another comfort than this world,\\nThat thou neglect me not, with that opinion\\nThat I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible\\nThat which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible\\nBut one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,\\nMay seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute\\nAs Angelo; even so may Angelo,\\nIn all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,\\nBe an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:\\nIf he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,\\nHad I more name for badness.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBy mine honesty,\\nIf she be mad,--as I believe no other,--\\nHer madness hath the oddest frame of sense,\\nSuch a dependency of thing on thing,\\nAs e'er I heard in madness.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO gracious duke,\\nHarp not on that, nor do not banish reason\\nFor inequality; but let your reason serve\\nTo make the truth appear where it seems hid,\\nAnd hide the false seems true.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMany that are not mad\\nHave, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI am the sister of one Claudio,\\nCondemn'd upon the act of fornication\\nTo lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:\\nI, in probation of a sisterhood,\\nWas sent to by my brother; one Lucio\\nAs then the messenger,--\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThat's I, an't like your grace:\\nI came to her from Claudio, and desired her\\nTo try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo\\nFor her poor brother's pardon.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThat's he indeed.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou were not bid to speak.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNo, my good lord;\\nNor wish'd to hold my peace.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI wish you now, then;\\nPray you, take note of it: and when you have\\nA business for yourself, pray heaven you then\\nBe perfect.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI warrant your honour.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThe warrants for yourself; take heed to't.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThis gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nRight.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt may be right; but you are i' the wrong\\nTo speak before your time. Proceed.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI went\\nTo this pernicious caitiff deputy,--\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThat's somewhat madly spoken.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nPardon it;\\nThe phrase is to the matter.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMended again. The matter; proceed.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nIn brief, to set the needless process by,\\nHow I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,\\nHow he refell'd me, and how I replied,--\\nFor this was of much length,--the vile conclusion\\nI now begin with grief and shame to utter:\\nHe would not, but by gift of my chaste body\\nTo his concupiscible intemperate lust,\\nRelease my brother; and, after much debatement,\\nMy sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,\\nAnd I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,\\nHis purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant\\nFor my poor brother's head.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThis is most likely!\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, that it were as like as it is true!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBy heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,\\nOr else thou art suborn'd against his honour\\nIn hateful practise. First, his integrity\\nStands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason\\nThat with such vehemency he should pursue\\nFaults proper to himself: if he had so offended,\\nHe would have weigh'd thy brother by himself\\nAnd not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:\\nConfess the truth, and say by whose advice\\nThou camest here to complain.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAnd is this all?\\nThen, O you blessed ministers above,\\nKeep me in patience, and with ripen'd time\\nUnfold the evil which is here wrapt up\\nIn countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,\\nAs I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!\\nTo prison with her! Shall we thus permit\\nA blasting and a scandalous breath to fall\\nOn him so near us? This needs must be a practise.\\nWho knew of Your intent and coming hither?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nOne that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nA ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMy lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;\\nI do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord\\nFor certain words he spake against your grace\\nIn your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWords against me? this is a good friar, belike!\\nAnd to set on this wretched woman here\\nAgainst our substitute! Let this friar be found.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBut yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,\\nI saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,\\nA very scurvy fellow.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nBlessed be your royal grace!\\nI have stood by, my lord, and I have heard\\nYour royal ear abused. First, hath this woman\\nMost wrongfully accused your substitute,\\nWho is as free from touch or soil with her\\nAs she from one ungot.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWe did believe no less.\\nKnow you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nI know him for a man divine and holy;\\nNot scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,\\nAs he's reported by this gentleman;\\nAnd, on my trust, a man that never yet\\nDid, as he vouches, misreport your grace.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMy lord, most villanously; believe it.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nWell, he in time may come to clear himself;\\nBut at this instant he is sick my lord,\\nOf a strange fever. Upon his mere request,\\nBeing come to knowledge that there was complaint\\nIntended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,\\nTo speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know\\nIs true and false; and what he with his oath\\nAnd all probation will make up full clear,\\nWhensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.\\nTo justify this worthy nobleman,\\nSo vulgarly and personally accused,\\nHer shall you hear disproved to her eyes,\\nTill she herself confess it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nGood friar, let's hear it.\\nDo you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?\\nO heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!\\nGive us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;\\nIn this I'll be impartial; be you judge\\nOf your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?\\nFirst, let her show her face, and after speak.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nPardon, my lord; I will not show my face\\nUntil my husband bid me.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhat, are you married?\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNo, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAre you a maid?\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNo, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nA widow, then?\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNeither, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhy, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMy lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are\\nneither maid, widow, nor wife.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSilence that fellow: I would he had some cause\\nTo prattle for himself.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWell, my lord.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nMy lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;\\nAnd I confess besides I am no maid:\\nI have known my husband; yet my husband\\nKnows not that ever he knew me.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nHe was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nFor the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWell, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThis is no witness for Lord Angelo.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNow I come to't my lord\\nShe that accuses him of fornication,\\nIn self-same manner doth accuse my husband,\\nAnd charges him my lord, with such a time\\nWhen I'll depose I had him in mine arms\\nWith all the effect of love.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nCharges she more than me?\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNot that I know.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNo? you say your husband.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nWhy, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,\\nWho thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,\\nBut knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThis is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nMy husband bids me; now I will unmask.\\nThis is that face, thou cruel Angelo,\\nWhich once thou sworest was worth the looking on;\\nThis is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,\\nWas fast belock'd in thine; this is the body\\nThat took away the match from Isabel,\\nAnd did supply thee at thy garden-house\\nIn her imagined person.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nKnow you this woman?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nCarnally, she says.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSirrah, no more!\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nEnough, my lord.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nMy lord, I must confess I know this woman:\\nAnd five years since there was some speech of marriage\\nBetwixt myself and her; which was broke off,\\nPartly for that her promised proportions\\nCame short of composition, but in chief\\nFor that her reputation was disvalued\\nIn levity: since which time of five years\\nI never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,\\nUpon my faith and honour.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNoble prince,\\nAs there comes light from heaven and words from breath,\\nAs there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,\\nI am affianced this man's wife as strongly\\nAs words could make up vows: and, my good lord,\\nBut Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house\\nHe knew me as a wife. As this is true,\\nLet me in safety raise me from my knees\\nOr else for ever be confixed here,\\nA marble monument!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI did but smile till now:\\nNow, good my lord, give me the scope of justice\\nMy patience here is touch'd. I do perceive\\nThese poor informal women are no more\\nBut instruments of some more mightier member\\nThat sets them on: let me have way, my lord,\\nTo find this practise out.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAy, with my heart\\nAnd punish them to your height of pleasure.\\nThou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,\\nCompact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,\\nThough they would swear down each particular saint,\\nWere testimonies against his worth and credit\\nThat's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,\\nSit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains\\nTo find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.\\nThere is another friar that set them on;\\nLet him be sent for.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nWould he were here, my lord! for he indeed\\nHath set the women on to this complaint:\\nYour provost knows the place where he abides\\nAnd he may fetch him.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nGo do it instantly.\\nAnd you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,\\nWhom it concerns to hear this matter forth,\\nDo with your injuries as seems you best,\\nIn any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;\\nBut stir not you till you have well determined\\nUpon these slanderers.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nMy lord, we'll do it throughly.\\nSignior Lucio, did not you say you knew that\\nFriar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing\\nbut in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most\\nvillanous speeches of the duke.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWe shall entreat you to abide here till he come and\\nenforce them against him: we shall find this friar a\\nnotable fellow.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nAs any in Vienna, on my word.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nCall that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.\\nPray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you\\nshall see how I'll handle her.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNot better than he, by her own report.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nSay you?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMarry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,\\nshe would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,\\nshe'll be ashamed.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI will go darkly to work with her.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThat's the way; for women are light at midnight.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nCome on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all\\nthat you have said.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMy lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with\\nthe provost.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nIn very good time: speak not you to him till we\\ncall upon you.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMum.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nCome, sir: did you set these women on to slander\\nLord Angelo? they have confessed you did.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n'Tis false.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHow! know you where you are?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nRespect to your great place! and let the devil\\nBe sometime honour'd for his burning throne!\\nWhere is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nThe duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:\\nLook you speak justly.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBoldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,\\nCome you to seek the lamb here of the fox?\\nGood night to your redress! Is the duke gone?\\nThen is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,\\nThus to retort your manifest appeal,\\nAnd put your trial in the villain's mouth\\nWhich here you come to accuse.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThis is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhy, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,\\nIs't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women\\nTo accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth\\nAnd in the witness of his proper ear,\\nTo call him villain? and then to glance from him\\nTo the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?\\nTake him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you\\nJoint by joint, but we will know his purpose.\\nWhat 'unjust'!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBe not so hot; the duke\\nDare no more stretch this finger of mine than he\\nDare rack his own: his subject am I not,\\nNor here provincial. My business in this state\\nMade me a looker on here in Vienna,\\nWhere I have seen corruption boil and bubble\\nTill it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,\\nBut faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes\\nStand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,\\nAs much in mock as mark.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nSlander to the state! Away with him to prison!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhat can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?\\nIs this the man that you did tell us of?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:\\ndo you know me?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I\\nmet you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nO, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMost notedly, sir.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nDo you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a\\nfool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make\\nthat my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and\\nmuch more, much worse.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nO thou damnable fellow!

Away with\\nhim to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him\\nto prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him\\nspeak no more. Away with those giglots too, and\\nwith the other confederate companion!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhat, resists he? Help him, Lucio.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nCome, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you\\nbald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must\\nyou? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!\\nshow your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!\\nWill't not off?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.\\nFirst, provost, let me bail these gentle three.\\nSneak not away, sir; for the friar and you\\nMust have a word anon. Lay hold on him.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThis may prove worse than hanging.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nO my dread lord,\\nI should be guiltier than my guiltiness,\\nTo think I can be undiscernible,\\nWhen I perceive your grace, like power divine,\\nHath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,\\nNo longer session hold upon my shame,\\nBut let my trial be mine own confession:\\nImmediate sentence then and sequent death\\nIs all the grace I beg.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nCome hither, Mariana.\\nSay, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI was, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nGo take her hence, and marry her instantly.\\nDo you the office, friar; which consummate,\\nReturn him here again. Go with him, provost.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nMy lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour\\nThan at the strangeness of it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nCome hither, Isabel.\\nYour friar is now your prince: as I was then\\nAdvertising and holy to your business,\\nNot changing heart with habit, I am still\\nAttorney'd at your service.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, give me pardon,\\nThat I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd\\nYour unknown sovereignty!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou are pardon'd, Isabel:\\nAnd now, dear maid, be you as free to us.\\nYour brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;\\nAnd you may marvel why I obscured myself,\\nLabouring to save his life, and would not rather\\nMake rash remonstrance of my hidden power\\nThan let him so be lost. O most kind maid,\\nIt was the swift celerity of his death,\\nWhich I did think with slower foot came on,\\nThat brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!\\nThat life is better life, past fearing death,\\nThan that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,\\nSo happy is your brother.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI do, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nFor this new-married man approaching here,\\nWhose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd\\nYour well defended honour, you must pardon\\nFor Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--\\nBeing criminal, in double violation\\nOf sacred chastity and of promise-breach\\nThereon dependent, for your brother's life,--\\nThe very mercy of the law cries out\\nMost audible, even from his proper tongue,\\n'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'\\nHaste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;\\nLike doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.\\nThen, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;\\nWhich, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.\\nWe do condemn thee to the very block\\nWhere Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.\\nAway with him!\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nO my most gracious lord,\\nI hope you will not mock me with a husband.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is your husband mock'd you with a husband.\\nConsenting to the safeguard of your honour,\\nI thought your marriage fit; else imputation,\\nFor that he knew you, might reproach your life\\nAnd choke your good to come; for his possessions,\\nAlthough by confiscation they are ours,\\nWe do instate and widow you withal,\\nTo buy you a better husband.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nO my dear lord,\\nI crave no other, nor no better man.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNever crave him; we are definitive.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nGentle my liege,--\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou do but lose your labour.\\nAway with him to death!\\nNow, sir, to you.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nO my good lord!

officer come  come  they are almost here  how many standfor consulships second officer three  they say  but  tis thought of every onecoriolanus will carry it first officer that s a brave fellow  but he s vengeance proud  andloves not the common people second officer faith  there had been many great men that haveflattered the people  who ne er loved them  and therebe many that they have loved  they know notwherefore  so that  if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground  therefore  forcoriolanus neither to care whether they love or hatehim manifests the true knowledge he has in theirdisposition  and out of his noble carelessness letsthem plainly see t first officer if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently  twixt doing them neithergood nor harm  but he seeks their hate with greaterdevotion than can render it him  and leavesnothing undone that may fully discover him theiropposite  now  to seem to affect the malice anddispleasure of the people is as bad as that which hedislikes  to flatter them for their love second officer he hath deserved worthily of his country  and hisascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted  without any further deed to have them atan into their estimation and report  but he hath soplanted his honours in their eyes  and his actionsin their hearts  that for their tongues to besilent  and not confess so much  were a kind ofingrateful injury  to report otherwise  were amalice  that  giving itself the lie  would pluckreproof and rebuke from

and take our friendly senators by the hands who now are here  taking their leaves of me who am prepared against your territories though not for rome itself coriolanus you bless me  gods aufidius therefore  most absolute sir  if thou wilt havethe leading of thine own revenges  takethe one half of my commission  and set down  as best thou art experienced  since thou know stthy country s strength and weakness   thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them  ere destroy  but come in let me commend thee first to those that shallsay yea to thy desires  a thousand welcomes and more a friend than e er an enemy yet  marcius  that was much  your hand  most welcome first servingman here s a strange alteration second servingman by my hand  i had thought to have strucken him witha cudgel  and yet my mind gave me his clothes made afalse report of him first servingman what an arm he has  he turned me about with hisfinger and his thumb  as one would set up a top second servingman nay  i knew by his face that there was something inhim  he had  sir  a kind of face  methought   icannot tell how to term it first servingman he had so  looking as it were  would i were hanged but i thought there was more in him than i could think second servingman so did i  i ll be sworn  he is simply the rarestman i  the world first servingman i think he is  but a greater soldier than he you wot on second servingman who  my master first servingman nay  it s no matter for that second servingman worth six on him first servingman nay  not so neither  but i take him to be thegreater soldier second servingman faith  look you  one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town  our general is excellent first servingman ay  and for an assault too third servingman o slaves  i can tell you news    news  you rascals first servingman what  what  what  let s partake third servingman i would not be a roman  of all nations  i had aslieve be a condemned man first servingman wherefore  wherefore third servingman why  here s he that was wont to thwack our general caius marcius first servingman why do you say  thwack our general   third servingman i do not say  thwack our general   but he was alwaysgood enough for him second servingman come  we are fellows and friends  he was ever toohard for him  i have heard him say so himself first servingman he was too hard for him directly  to say the trothon t  before corioli he scotched him and notchedhim like a carbon ado second servingman an he had been cannibally given  he might havebroiled and eaten him too first servingman but  more of thy news third servingman why  he is so made on here within  as if he were sonand heir to mars  set at upper end o  the table  noquestion asked him by any of the senators  but theystand bald before him  our general himself makes amistress of him  sanctifies himself with s hand andturns up the white o  the eye to his discourse  butthe bottom of the news is that our general is cut i the middle and but one half of what he wasyesterday  for the other has half  by the entreatyand grant of the whole table  he ll go  he says and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears  hewill mow all down before him  and leave his passage polled second servingman and he s as like to do t as any man i can imagine third servingman do t  he will do t  for  look you  sir  he has asmany friends as enemies  which friends  sir  as itwere  durst not  look you  sir  show themselves  aswe term it  his friends whilst he s in directitude first servingman directitude  what s that third servingman but when they shall see  sir  his crest up again and the man in blood  they will out of theirburrows  like conies after rain  and revel all withhim first servingman but when goes this forward third servingman to morrow  to day  presently  you shall have thedrum struck up this afternoon   tis  as it were  aparcel of their feast  and to be executed ere theywipe their lips second servingman why  then we shall have a stirring world again this peace is nothing  but to rust iron  increasetailors  and breed ballad makers first servingman let me have war  say i  it exceeds peace as far asday does night  it s spritely  waking  audible  andfull of vent  peace is a very apoplexy  lethargy mulled  deaf  sleepy  insensible  a getter of morebastard children than war s a destroyer of men second servingman  tis so  and as war  in some sort  may be said tobe a ravisher  so it cannot be denied but peace is agreat maker of cuckolds first servingman ay  and it makes men hate one another third servingman reason  because they then less need one another the wars for my money  i hope to see romans as cheapas volscians  they are rising  they are rising all in  in  in  in sicinius we hear not of him  neither need we fear him his remedies are tame i  the present peaceand quietness of the people  which beforewere in wild

crying confusion brutus caius marcius wasa worthy officer i  the war  but insolent o ercome with pride  ambitious past all thinking self loving   sicinius and affecting one sole throne without assistance menenius i think not so sicinius we should by this  to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul  found it so brutus the gods have well prevented it  and romesits safe and still without him aedile worthy tribunes there is a slave  whom we have put in prison reports  the volsces with two several powersare enter d in the roman territories and with the deepest malice of the

not once peep out sicinius come  what talk youof marcius brutus go see this rumourer whipp d  it cannot bethe volsces dare break with us menenius cannot be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like have beenwithin my age  but reason with the fellow before you punish him  where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your informationand beat the messenger who bids

is deliver d sicinius what more fearful messenger it is spoke freely out of many mouths  how probable i do not know  that marcius join d with aufidius  leads a power  gainst rome and vows revenge as spacious as betweenthe young st and oldest thing sicinius this is most likely brutus raised only  that the weaker sort may wishgood marcius home again sicinius the very trick on t menenius this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atonethan violentest contrariety second messenger you are sent for to the senate a fearful army  led by caius marciusassociated with aufidius  ragesupon our

help both tribunes say not we brought it menenius how  was it we  we loved him but  like beastsand cowardly nobles  gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o  the city cominius but i fearthey ll roar him in again  tullus aufidius the second name of men  obeys his pointsas if he were his officer  desperationis all the policy  strength and defence that rome can make against them menenius here come the clusters and is aufidius with him  you are theythat made the air unwholesome  when you castyour stinking greasy caps in hooting atcoriolanus  exile  now he s coming and not a hair upon a

verymany of us  that we did  we did for the best  andthough we willingly consented to his banishment  yetit was against our will cominius ye re goodly things  you voices menenius you have madegood

action of yourself  or elseto him had left it solely aufidius i understand thee well  and be thou sure when he shall come to his account  he knows notwhat i can urge against him  although it seems and so he thinks  and is no less apparentto the vulgar eye  that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragon like  and does achieve as soonas draw his sword  yet he hath left undonethat which shall break his neck or hazard mine whene er we come to our account lieutenant sir  i beseech you  think you he ll carry rome aufidius all places yield to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers  and their peoplewill be as rash in the repeal  as hastyto expel him thence  i think he ll be to romeas is the osprey to the fish  who takes itby sovereignty of nature  first he wasa noble servant to them  but he could notcarry his honours even  whether  twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taintsthe happy man  whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chanceswhich he was lord of  or whether nature not to be other than one thing  not movingfrom the casque to the cushion  but commanding peaceeven with the same austerity and garbas he controll d the war  but one of these  as he hath spices of them all  not all for i dare so far free him  made him fear d so hated  and so banish d  but he has a merit to choke it in the utterance  so our virtueslie in the interpretation of the time and power  unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a

titleless till he had forged himself a name o  the fireof burning rome menenius why  so  you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have rack d for rome to make coals cheap   a noble memory cominius i minded him how royal  twas to pardonwhen it was less expected  he replied it was a bare petition of a stateto one whom they had punish d menenius very well could he say less cominius i offer d to awaken his regardfor s private friends  his answer to me was he could not stay to pick them in a pileof noisome musty chaff  he said  twas folly for one poor grain or two  to leave unburnt and still to nose the offence menenius for one poor grain or two i am one of those  his mother  wife  his child and this brave fellow too  we are the grains you are the musty chaff  and you are

at good cominius  much unhearts me he was not taken well  he had not dined the veins unfill d  our blood is cold  and thenwe pout upon the morning  are unaptto give or to forgive  but when we have stuff dthese and these conveyances of our bloodwith wine and feeding  we have suppler soulsthan in our priest like fasts  therefore i ll watch himtill he be dieted to my request and then i ll set upon him brutus you know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your way menenius good faith  i ll prove him speed how it will  i shall ere long have knowledgeof my success cominius he ll never

cheekslike trees bedash d with rain  in that sad timemy manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath  and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues  and prompts my tongue to speak teach not thy lips such scorn  for they were madefor kissing  lady  not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo  here i lend thee this sharp pointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true bosom and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee nay  do not pause  for i did kill king henry but  twas thy beauty that provoked me nay  now

executioner gloucester then bid me kill myself  and i will do it lady anne i have already gloucester tush  that was in thy rage speak it again  and  even with the word that hand  which  for thy love

england i prophesy the fearful st time to theethat ever wretched age hath look d upon come  lead me to the block  bear him my head they smile at me that shortly shall be dead gloucester come  cousin

buckingham hark  a drum gloucester catesby  o erlook the walls buckingham lord mayor  the reason we have sent  gloucester look back  defend thee  here are enemies buckingham god and our innocency defend and guard us gloucester be patient  they are friends  ratcliff and lovel lovel here is the head of that ignoble traitor the dangerous and unsuspected hastings gloucester so dear i loved the man  that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creaturethat breathed upon this earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recordedthe history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daub d his vice with show of virtue that  his apparent open guilt omitted i mean  his conversation with shore s wife he lived from all attainder of suspect buckingham well  well  he was the covert st shelter d traitorthat ever lived would you imagine  or almost believe were t not that  by great preservation we live to tell it you  the subtle traitorthis day had plotted  in the council houseto murder me and my good lord of gloucester lord mayor what  had he so gloucester what  think you we are turks or infidels or that we would  against the form of law proceed thus rashly to the villain s death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons  safety enforced us to this execution lord mayor now  fair befall you  he deserved his death and you my good lords  both have well proceeded to warn false traitors from the like attempts i never look d for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore gloucester yet had not we determined he should die until your lordship came to see his death which now the loving haste of these our friends somewhat against our meaning  have prevented because  my lord  we would have had you heardthe traitor speak  and timorously confessthe manner and the purpose of his treason that you might well have signified the sameunto the citizens  who haply maymisconstrue us in him and wail his death lord mayor but  my good lord  your grace s word shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speakand doubt you not  right noble princes both but i ll acquaint our duteous citizenswith all your just proceedings in this cause gloucester and to that end we wish d your lord ship here to avoid the carping censures of the world buckingham but since you come too late of our intents yet witness what you hear we did intend and so  my good lord mayor  we bid farewell gloucester go  after  after  cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there  at your meet st advantage of the time infer the bastardy of edward s children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his sonheir to the crown  meaning indeed his house which  by the sign thereof was termed so moreover  urge his hateful luxuryand bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched to their servants  daughters  wives even where his lustful eye or savage heart without control  listed to make his prey nay  for a need  thus far come near my person tell them  when that my mother went with childof that unsatiate edward  noble yorkmy princely father then had wars in franceand  by just computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father but touch this sparingly  as  twere far off because you know  my lord  my mother lives buckingham fear not  my lord  i ll play the oratoras if the golden fee for which i pleadwere for myself  and so  my lord  adieu gloucester if you thrive well  bring them to baynard s castle where you shall find me well accompaniedwith reverend fathers and well learned bishops buckingham i go  and towards three or four o clocklook for the news that the guildhall affords gloucester go  lovel  with all speed to doctor shaw go thou to friar penker  bid them bothmeet me within this hour at baynard s castle now will i in  to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give notice  that no manner of personat any time have recourse unto the princes scrivener this is the indictment of the good lord hastings which in a set hand fairly is engross d that it may be this day read over in paul s and mark how well the sequel hangs together eleven hours i spent to write it over for yesternight by catesby was it brought me the precedent was full as long a doing and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings untainted  unexamined  free  at libertyhere s a good world the while  why who s so gross that seeth not this palpable device yet who s so blind  but says he sees it not bad is the world  and all will come to nought when such bad dealings must be seen in thought gloucester how now  my lord  what say the citizens buckingham now  by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum and speak not a word gloucester touch d you the bastardy of edward s children buckingham i did  with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france the insatiate greediness of his desires and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles  his own bastardy as being got  your father then in france his resemblance  being not like the duke withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your dicipline in war  wisdom in peace your bounty  virtue  fair humility indeed  left nothing fitting for the purposeuntouch d  or slightly handled  in discourseand when mine oratory grew to an endi bid them that did love their country s goodcry  god save richard  england s royal king  gloucester ah  and did they so buckingham no  so god help me  they spake not a word but  like dumb statues or breathing stones gazed each on other  and look d deadly pale which when i saw  i reprehended them and ask d the mayor what meant this wilful silence his answer was  the people were not wontto be spoke to but by the recorder then he was urged to tell my tale again  thus saith the duke  thus hath the duke inferr d  but nothing spake in warrant from himself when he had done  some followers of mine own at the lower end of the hall  hurl d up their caps and some ten voices cried  god save king richard  and thus i took the vantage of those few  thanks  gentle citizens and friends   quoth i  this general applause and loving shoutargues your wisdoms and your love to richard  and even here brake off  and came away gloucester what tongueless blocks were they  would not they speak buckingham no  by my troth  my lord gloucester will not the mayor then and his brethren come buckingham the mayor is here at hand  intend some fear be not you spoke with  but by mighty suit and look you get a prayer book in your hand and stand betwixt two churchmen  good my lord for on that ground i ll build a holy descant and be not easily won to our request play the maid s part  still answer nay  and take it gloucester i go  and if you plead as well for themas i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt well bring it to a happy issue buckingham go  go  up to the leads  the lord mayor knocks welcome my lord  i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal here comes his servant  how now  catesby what says he catesby my lord  he doth entreat your grace to visit him to morrow or next day he is within  with two right reverend fathers divinely bent to meditation and no worldly suit would he be moved to draw him from his holy exercise buckingham return  good catesby  to thy lord again tell him  myself  the mayor and citizens in deep designs and matters of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace catesby i ll tell him what you say  my lord buckingham ah  ha  my lord  this prince is not an edward he is not lolling on a lewd day bed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtezans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping  to engross his idle body but praying  to enrich his watchful soul happy were england  would this gracious princetake on himself the sovereignty thereof but  sure  i fear  we shall ne er win him to it lord mayor marry  god forbid his grace should say us nay buckingham i fear he will how now  catesby  what says your lord catesby my lord he wonders to what end you have assembledsuch troops of citizens to speak with him his grace not being warn d thereof before my lord  he fears you mean no good to him buckingham sorry i am my noble cousin shouldsuspect me  that i mean no good to him by heaven  i come in perfect love to him and so once more return and tell his grace when holy and devout religious menare at their beads   tis hard to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation lord mayor see  where he stands between two clergymen buckingham two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and  see  a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man famous plantagenet  most gracious prince lend favourable ears to our request and pardon us the interruptionof thy devotion and right christian zeal gloucester my lord  there needs no such apology i rather do beseech you pardon me who  earnest in the service of my god neglect the visitation of my friends but  leaving this  what is your grace s pleasure buckingham even that  i hope  which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungovern d isle gloucester i do suspect i have done some offencethat seems disgracious in the city s eyes and that you come to reprehend my ignorance buckingham you have  my lord  would it might please your grace at our entreaties  to amend that fault gloucester else wherefore breathe i in a christian land buckingham then know  it is your fault that you resignthe supreme seat  the throne majestical the scepter d office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemished stock whilst  in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our country s good this noble isle doth want her proper limbs her face defaced with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shoulder d in the swallowing gulfof blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion which to recure  we heartily solicityour gracious self to take on you the chargeand kingly government of this your land not as protector  steward  substitute or lowly factor for another s gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth  your empery  your own for this  consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just suit come i to move your grace gloucester i know not whether to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your conditionif not to answer  you might haply thinktongue tied ambition  not replying  yieldedto bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so season d with your faithful love to me then  on the other side  i cheque d my friends therefore  to speak  and to avoid the first and then  in speaking  not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks  but my desertunmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as my ripe revenue and due by birthyet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects as i had rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smother d but  god be thank d  there s no need of me and much i need to help you  if need were the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which  mellow d by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make  no doubt  us happy by his reign on him i lay what you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him buckingham my lord  this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well considered you say that edward is your brother s son so say we too  but not by edward s wife for first he was contract to lady lucy  your mother lives a witness to that vow  and afterward by substitute betroth dto bona  sister to the king of france these both put by a poor petitioner a care crazed mother of a many children a beauty waning and distressed widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his lustful eye seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughtsto base declension and loathed bigamyby her  in his unlawful bed  he gotthis edward  whom our manners term the prince more bitterly could i expostulate save that  for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue then  good my lord  take to your royal selfthis proffer d benefit of dignity if non to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestryfrom the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal true derived course lord mayor do  good my lord  your citizens entreat you buckingham refuse not  mighty lord  this proffer d love catesby o  make them joyful  grant their lawful suit gloucester alas  why would you heap these cares on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you  take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you buckingham if you refuse it   as  in love and zeal loath to depose the child  your brother s son as well we know your tenderness of heartand gentle  kind  effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kin and egally indeed to all estates   yet whether you accept our suit or no your brother s son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you   come  citizens   zounds  i ll entreat no more gloucester o  do not swear  my lord of buckingham catesby call them again  my lord  and accept their suit another do  good my lord  lest all the land do rue it gloucester would you enforce me to a world of care well  call them again  i am not made of stone but penetrable to your  kind entreats albeit against my conscience and my soul cousin of buckingham  and you sage  grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burthen  whether i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foul faced reproachattend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance mefrom all the impure blots and stains thereof for god he knows  and you may partly see how far i am from the desire thereof lord mayor god bless

hath he pill d with grievous taxes and quite lost their hearts  the nobles hath he finedfor ancient quarrels  and quite lost their hearts lord willoughby and daily new exactions are devised as blanks  benevolences  and i wot not what but what  o  god s name  doth become of this northumberland wars have not wasted it  for warr d he hath not but basely yielded upon compromisethat which his noble

deaf  speak thou  northumberland northumberland hold  clifford  do not honour him so muchto prick thy finger  though to wound his heart what valour were it  when a cur doth grin for one to thrust his hand between his teeth when he might spurn him with his foot away it is war s prize to take all vantages and ten to one is no impeach of valour clifford ay  ay  so strives the woodcock with the gin northumberland so doth the cony struggle in the net york so triumph thieves upon their conquer d booty so true men yield  with robbers so o ermatch d northumberland what would your grace have done unto him now queen margaret brave warriors  clifford and northumberland come  make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstretched arms yet parted but the shadow with his

and the lusty george and where s that valiant crook back prodigy dicky your boy  that with his grumbling voicewas wont to cheer his dad in mutinies or  with the rest  where is your darling rutland look  york  i stain d this napkin with the bloodthat valiant clifford  with his rapier s point made issue from the bosom of the boy and if thine eyes can water for his death i give thee this to dry

king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henry s glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life  against your holy oath o   tis a fault too too unpardonable off with the crown  and with the crown his head and  whilst we breathe  take time to do him dead clifford that is my office  for my father s sake queen margaret nay  stay  lets hear the orisons he makes york she wolf of france  but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adder s tooth how ill beseeming is it in thy sexto triumph  like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is  vizard like  unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay  proud queen  to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou camest  of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee  wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not  nor it boots thee not  proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death  tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but  god he knows  thy share thereof is small  tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wonder d at  tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every goodas the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tiger s heart wrapt in a woman s hide how couldst thou drain the life blood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a woman s face women are soft  mild  pitiful and flexible thou stern  obdurate  flinty  rough  remorseless bids t thou me rage  why  now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep  why  now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays  the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutland s obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death  gainst thee  fell clifford  and thee  falsefrenchwoman northumberland beshrew me  but his passion moves me sothat hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears york that face of his the hungry cannibalswould not have touch d  would not have stain d with blood but you are more inhuman  more inexorable o  ten times more  than tigers of hyrcania see  ruthless queen  a hapless father s tears this cloth thou dip dst in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away keep thou the napkin  and go boast of this and if thou tell st the heavy story right upon my soul  the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fast falling tears and say  alas  it was a piteous deed  there  take the crown  and  with the crown  my curse and in thy need such comfort come to theeas now i reap at thy too cruel hand hard hearted clifford  take me from the world my soul to heaven  my blood upon your heads northumberland had he been slaughter man to all my kin i should not for my life but weep with him to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul queen margaret what  weeping ripe  my lord northumberland think but upon the wrong he did us all and that will quickly dry thy melting tears clifford here s for my oath  here s for my father s death queen margaret and here s to right our gentle hearted king york open thy gate of mercy  gracious god my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee queen margaret off with his head  and set it on york gates so york may overlook the town of york 3 king henry viedward i wonder how our princely father  scaped or whether he be  scaped away or nofrom clifford s and northumberland s pursuit had he been ta en  we should have heard the news had he been slain  we should have heard the news or had he  scaped  methinks we should have heardthe happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother  why is he so sad richard i cannot joy  until i be resolvedwhere our right valiant father is become i saw him in the battle range about and watch d him how he singled clifford forth methought he bore him in the thickest troopas doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear  encompass d round with dogs who having pinch d a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof  and bark at him so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks   tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimm d like a younker prancing to his love edward dazzle mine eyes  or do i see three suns richard three glorious suns  each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but sever d in a pale clear shining sky see  see  they join  embrace  and seem to kiss as if they vow d some league inviolable now are they but one lamp  one light  one sun in this the heaven figures some event edward  tis wondrous strange  the like yet never heard of i think it cites us  brother  to the field that we  the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights togetherand over shine the earth as this the world whate er it bodes  henceforward will i bearupon my target three fair shining suns richard nay  bear three daughters  by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male but what art thou  whose heavy looks foretellsome dreadful story hanging on thy tongue messenger ah  one that was a woful looker onwhen as the noble duke of york was slain your princely father and my loving lord edward o  speak no more  for i have heard too much richard say how he died  for i will hear it all messenger environed he was with many foes and stood against them  as the hope of troyagainst the greeks that

slaughter d by the ireful armof unrelenting clifford and the queen who crown d the gracious duke in high despite laugh d in his face  and when with grief he wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeksa napkin steeped in the harmless bloodof sweet young rutland  by rough clifford slain and after many scorns  many foul taunts they took his head  and on the gates of yorkthey set the same  and there it doth remain the saddest spectacle that e er i view d edward sweet duke of york  our prop to lean upon now thou art gone  we have no staff  no stay o clifford  boisterous clifford  thou hast slainthe flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquish d him for hand to hand he would have vanquish d thee now my soul s palace is become a prison ah  would she break from hence  that this my bodymight in the ground be closed up in rest for never henceforth shall i joy again never  o never shall i see more joy richard i cannot weep  for all my body s moisturescarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart nor can my tongue unload my heart s great burthen for selfsame wind that i should speak withalis kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes  blows and revenge for merichard  i bear thy name  i ll venge thy death or die renowned by attempting it edward his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left richard nay  if thou be that princely eagle s bird show thy descent by gazing  gainst the sun for chair and dukedom  throne and kingdom say either that is thine  or else thou wert not his warwick how now  fair lords  what fare  what news abroad richard great lord of warwick  if we should recountour baleful news  and at each word s deliverancestab poniards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds o valiant lord  the duke of york is slain edward o warwick  warwick  that plantagenet which held three dearly as his soul s redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death warwick ten days ago i drown d these news in tears and now  to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befall n after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings  as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i  then in london keeper of the king muster d my soldiers  gather d flocks of friends and very well appointed  as i thought march d toward saint alban s to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertisedthat she was coming with a full intentto dash our late decree in parliamenttouching king henry s oath and your succession short tale to make  we at saint alban s metour battles join d  and both sides fiercely fought but whether  twas the coldness of the king who look d full gently on his warlike queen that robb d my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether  twas report of her success or more than common fear of clifford s rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge  but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers   like the night owl s lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down  as if they struck their friends i cheer d them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain  they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled  the king unto the queen lord george your brother  norfolk and myself in haste  post haste  are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again edward where is the duke of norfolk  gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england warwick some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother  he was lately sentfrom your kind aunt  duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war richard  twas odds  belike  when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but ne er till now his scandal of retire warwick nor now my scandal  richard  dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of minecan pluck the diadem from faint henry s head and wring the awful sceptre from his fist were he as famous and as bold in waras he is famed for mildness  peace  and prayer richard i know it well  lord warwick  blame me not  tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak but in this troublous time what s to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numbering our ave maries with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foestell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last  say ay  and to it  lords warwick why  therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me  lords  the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easy melting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what besidemay make against the house of lancaster their power  i think  is thirty thousand strong now  if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou  brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why  via  to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry  charge upon our foes  but never once again turn back and fly richard ay  now methinks i hear great warwick speak ne er may he live to see a sunshine day that cries  retire   if warwick bid him stay edward lord warwick  on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou fail st  as god forbid the hour   must edward fall  which peril heaven forfend warwick no longer earl of march  but duke of york the next degree is england s royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaim din every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his

peck in safeguard of their brood ambitious york doth level at thy crown thou smiling while he knit his angry brows he  but a duke  would have his son a king and raise his issue  like a loving sire thou  being a king  blest with a goodly son didst yield consent to disinherit him which argued thee a most unloving father unreasonable creatures feed their young and though man s face be fearful to

whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answered edward bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound and his ill boding tongue no more shall speak warwick i think his understanding is bereft speak  clifford  dost thou know who speaks to thee dark cloudy death o ershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say richard o  would he did  and so perhaps he doth  tis but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter tauntswhich in the time of death he gave our father george if so thou think st  vex him with eager words richard clifford  ask mercy and obtain no grace edward clifford  repent in bootless penitence warwick clifford  devise excuses for thy faults george while we devise fell tortures for thy faults richard thou didst love york  and i am son to york edward thou pitied st rutland  i will pity thee george where s captain margaret  to fence you now warwick they mock thee  clifford  swear as thou wast wont richard what  not an oath  nay  then the world goes hardwhen clifford cannot spare his friends an oath i know by that he s dead  and  by my soul if this right hand would buy two hour s life that i in all despite might rail at him this hand should chop it off  and with theissuing bloodstifle the villain whose unstanched thirstyork and young rutland could not satisfy warwick ay  but he s dead  off with the traitor s head and rear it in the place your father s stands and now to london with triumphant march there to be crowned england s royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and  having france thy friend  thou shalt

that took him to question of his apprehension widow  go you along  lords  use her honourably gloucester ay  edward will use women honourably would he were wasted  marrow  bones and all that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet  between my soul s desire and me  the lustful edward s title buried  is clarence  henry  and his son young edward and all the unlook d for issue of their bodies to take their rooms  ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose why  then  i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a far off shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying  he ll lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown  being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say  i ll cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eye s too quick  my heart o erweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well  say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford i ll make my heaven in a lady s lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought  and more unlikelythan to accomplish twenty golden crowns why  love forswore me in my mother s womb and  for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a wither d shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos  or an unlick d bear whelpthat carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be beloved o monstrous fault  to harbour such a thought then  since this earth affords no joy to me but to command  to cheque  to o erbear suchas are of better person than myself i ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and  whiles i live  to account this world but hell until my mis shaped trunk that bears this headbe round impaled with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i   like one lost in a thorny wood that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out   torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why  i can smile  and murder whiles i smile and cry  content  to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions i ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall i ll slay more gazers than the basilisk i ll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slily than ulysses could and  like a sinon  take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this  and cannot get a crown tut  were it farther off  i ll pluck it down 3 king henry viking lewis xi fair queen of england  worthy margaret sit

king in lawful marriage queen margaret warwick queen margaret king lewis and lady bona  hear me speak before you answer warwick  his demandsprings not from edward s well meant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still  but were he dead yet here prince edward stands  king henry s son look  therefore  lewis  that by this league and marriagethou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heavens are just  and time suppresseth wrongs warwick injurious margaret prince edward and why not queen warwick because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more are prince than she is queen oxford then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and  after john of gaunt  henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and  after that wise prince  henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends warwick oxford  how haps it  in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lostall that which henry fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest  you tell a pedigreeof threescore and two years  a silly timeto make prescription for a kingdom s worth oxford why  warwick  canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyed st thirty and six years and not bewray thy treason with a blush warwick can oxford  that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame  leave henry  and call edward king oxford call him my king by whose injurious doommy elder brother  the lord aubrey vere was done to death  and more than so  my father even in the downfall of his mellow d years when nature brought him to the door of death no  warwick  no  while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster warwick and i the house of york king lewis xi queen margaret  prince edward  and oxford vouchsafe  at our request  to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick queen margaret heavens grant that warwick s words bewitch him not king lewis xi now warwick  tell me  even upon thy conscience is edward your true king  for i were loathto link with him that were not lawful chosen warwick thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour king lewis xi but is he gracious in the people s eye warwick the more that henry was unfortunate king lewis xi then further  all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his loveunto our sister bona warwick such it seemsas may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swearthat this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fix d in virtue s ground the leaves and fruit maintain d with beauty s sun exempt from envy  but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain king lewis xi now  sister  let us hear your firm resolve bona your grant  or your denial  shall be mine yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your king s desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire king lewis xi then  warwick  thus  our sister shall be edward s and now forthwith shall articles be drawntouching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpoised draw near  queen margaret  and be a witnessthat bona shall be wife to the english king prince edward to edward  but not to the english king queen margaret deceitful warwick  it was thy deviceby this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henry s friend king lewis xi and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edward s good success then  tis but reason that i be releasedfrom giving aid which late i promised yet shall you have all kindness at my handthat your estate requires and mine can yield warwick henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing  nothing can he lose and as for you yourself  our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better  twere you troubled him than france queen margaret peace  impudent and shameless warwick  peace proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence  till  with my talk and tears both full of truth  i make king lewis beholdthy sly conveyance and thy lord s false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather king lewis xi warwick  this is some post to us or thee post oxford i like it well that our fair queen and mistresssmiles at her news  while warwick frowns at his prince edward nay  mark how lewis stamps  as he were nettled i hope all s for the best king lewis xi warwick  what are thy news  and yours  fair queen queen margaret mine  such as fill my heart with unhoped joys warwick mine  full of sorrow and heart s discontent king lewis xi what  has your king married the lady grey and now  to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience is this the alliance that he seeks with france dare he presume to scorn us in this manner queen margaret i told your majesty as much before this proveth edward s love and warwick s honesty warwick king lewis  i here protest  in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edward s no more my king  for he dishonours me but most himself  if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of yorkmy father came untimely to his death did i let pass the abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdon d at the last with shame shame on himself  for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen  let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state queen margaret warwick  these words have turn d my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becomest king henry s friend warwick so much his friend  ay  his unfeigned friend that  if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish uswith some few bands of chosen soldiers i ll undertake to land them on our coastand force the tyrant from his seat by war  tis not his new made bride shall succor him and as for clarence  as my letters tell me he s very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country bona dear brother  how shall bona be revengedbut by thy help to this distressed queen queen margaret renowned prince  how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair bona my quarrel and this english queen s are one warwick and mine  fair lady bona  joins with yours king lewis xi and mine with hers  and thine  and margaret s therefore at last i firmly am resolvedyou shall have aid queen margaret let me give humble thanks for all at once king lewis xi then  england s messenger  return in post and tell false edward  thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquersto revel it with him and his new bride thou seest what s past  go fear thy king withal bona tell him  in hope he ll prove a widower shortly i ll wear the willow garland for his sake queen margaret tell him  my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on warwick tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i ll uncrown him ere t be long there s thy reward  be gone king lewis xi but  warwick thou and oxford  with five thousand men shall cross the seas  and bid false edward battle and  as occasion serves  this noble queenand prince shall follow with a fresh supply yet  ere thou go  but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty warwick this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree i ll join mine eldest daughter and my joyto him forthwith in holy wedlock bands queen margaret yes  i agree  and thank you for your motion son edward  she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not  give thy hand to warwick and  with thy hand  thy faith irrevocable that only warwick s daughter shall be thine prince edward yes  i accept her  for she well deserves it and here  to pledge my vow  i give my hand king lewis xi why stay we now  these soldiers shall be levied and thou  lord bourbon  our high admiral shalt waft them over with our royal fleet i long till edward fall by war s mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of france warwick i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and i ll be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henry s misery but seek revenge on edward s mockery 3 king henry vigloucester now tell me  brother clarence  what think youof this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice clarence alas  you know   tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return somerset my lords  forbear this talk  here comes the king gloucester and his well chosen bride clarence i mind to tell him plainly what i think king edward iv now  brother of clarence  how like you our choice that you stand pensive  as half malcontent clarence as well as lewis of france  or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgmentthat they ll take no offence at our abuse king edward iv suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick  i am edward your king and warwick s  and must have my will gloucester and shall have your will  because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well king edward iv yea  brother richard  are you offended too gloucester not i no  god forbid that i should wish them sever dwhom god hath join d together  ay  and  twere pityto sunder them that yoke so well together king edward iv setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady greyshould not become my wife and england s queen and you too  somerset and montague speak freely what you think clarence then this is mine opinion  that king lewisbecomes your enemy  for mocking himabout the marriage of the lady bona gloucester and warwick  doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage king edward iv what if both lewis and warwick be appeasedby such invention as i can devise montague yet  to have join d with france in such alliancewould more have strengthen d this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any home bred marriage hastings why  knows not montague that of itselfengland is safe  if true within itself montague but the safer when  tis back d with france hastings  tis better using france than trusting france let us be back d with god and with the seaswhich he hath given for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies clarence for this one speech lord hastings well deservesto have the heir of the lord hungerford king edward iv ay  what of that  it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law gloucester and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scalesunto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood clarence or else you would not have bestow d the heirof the lord bonville on your new wife s son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere king edward iv alas  poor clarence  is it for a wifethat thou art malcontent  i will provide thee clarence in choosing for yourself  you show d your judgment which being shallow  you give me leaveto play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you king edward iv leave me  or tarry  edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother s will queen elizabeth my lords  before it pleased his majestyto raise my state to title of a queen do me but right  and you must all confessthat i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislike  to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow king edward iv my love  forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign  whom they must obey nay  whom they shall obey  and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do  yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath gloucester king edward iv now  messenger  what letters or what newsfrom france post my sovereign liege  no letters  and few words but such as i  without your special pardon dare not relate king edward iv go to  we pardon thee  therefore  in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters post at my depart  these were his very words  go tell false edward  thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquersto revel it with him and his new bride  king edward iv is lewis so brave  belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage post these were her words  utter d with mad disdain  tell him  in hope he ll prove a widower shortly i ll wear the willow garland for his sake  king edward iv i blame not her  she could say little less she had the wrong  but what said henry s queen for i have heard that she was there in place post  tell him   quoth she   my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on  king edward iv belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries post he  more incensed against your majestythan all the rest  discharged me with these words  tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i ll uncrown him ere t be long  king edward iv ha  durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me  being thus forewarn d they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say  is warwick friends with margaret post ay  gracious sovereign  they are so link d infriendshipthat young prince edward marries warwick s daughter clarence belike the elder  clarence will have the younger now  brother king  farewell  and sit you fast for i will hence to warwick s other daughter that  though i want a kingdom  yet in marriagei may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick  follow me gloucester king edward iv clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i arm d against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desperate case pembroke and stafford  you in our behalfgo levy men  and make prepare for war they are already  or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you but  ere i go  hastings and montague resolve my doubt  you twain  of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so  then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect montague so god help montague as he proves true hastings and hastings as he favours edward s cause king edward iv now  brother richard  will you stand by us gloucester ay  in despite of all that shall withstand you king edward iv why  so  then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence  and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power 3 king henry viwarwick trust me  my lord  all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us but see where somerset and clarence come speak suddenly  my lords  are we all friends clarence fear not that  my lord warwick then  gentle clarence  welcome unto warwick and welcome  somerset  i hold it cowardiceto rest mistrustful where a noble hearthath pawn d an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence  edward s brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome  sweet clarence  my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but  in night s coverture thy brother being carelessly encamp d his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomedewith sleight and manhood stole to rhesus  tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we  well cover d with the night s black mantle at unawares may beat down edward s guardand seize himself  i say not  slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader why  then  let s on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends  god and saint george 3 king henry vifirst watchman come on  my masters  each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep second watchman what  will he not to bed first watchman why  no  for he hath

watchman but say  i pray  what nobleman is thatthat with the king here resteth in his tent first watchman  tis the lord hastings  the king s chiefest friend third watchman o  is it so  but why commands the kingthat his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field second watchman  tis the more honour  because more dangerous third watchman ay  but give me worship and quietness i like it better than a dangerous honour if warwick knew in what estate he stands  tis to be doubted he would waken him first watchman unless our halberds did shut up his passage second watchman ay  wherefore else guard we his royal tent but to defend his person from night foes warwick this is his tent  and see where stand his guard courage  my masters  honour now or never but follow me  and edward shall be ours first watchman who goes there second watchman stay  or thou diest somerset what are they that fly there warwick richard and hastings  let them go  here is the duke

to create you duke of york alas  how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the people s welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies king edward iv yea  brother of clarence  are thou here too nay  then i see that edward needs must down yet  warwick  in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king though fortune s malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel warwick then  for his mind

master lieutenant  now that god and friendshave shaken edward from the regal seat and turn d my captive state to liberty my fear to hope  my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees lieutenant subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns but if an humble prayer may prevail i then crave pardon of your majesty king henry vi for what  lieutenant  for well using me nay  be thou sure i ll well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay  such a pleasure as incaged birdsconceive when after many moody thoughtsat last by notes of household harmonythey quite forget their loss of liberty but  warwick  after god  thou set st me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author  thou the instrument therefore  that i may conquer fortune s spiteby living low  where fortune cannot hurt me and that the people of this blessed landmay not be punish d with my thwarting stars warwick  although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds warwick your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortune s malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place clarence no  warwick  thou art worthy of the sway to whom the heavens in thy nativityadjudged an olive branch and laurel crown as likely to be blest in peace and war and therefore i yield thee my free consent warwick and i choose clarence only for protector king henry vi warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands  and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private lifeand in devotion spend my latter days to sin s rebuke and my creator s praise warwick what answers clarence to his sovereign s will clarence that he consents  if warwick yield consent for on thy fortune i repose myself warwick why  then  though loath  yet must i be content we ll yoke together  like a double shadowto henry s body  and supply his place i mean  in bearing weight of government while he enjoys the honour and his ease and  clarence  now then it is more than needfulforthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate clarence what else  and that succession be determined warwick ay  therein clarence shall not want his part king henry vi but  with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat  for i command no more that

sovereign  to providea salve for any sore that may betide somerset my lord  i like not of this flight of edward s for doubtless burgundy will yield him help and we shall have more wars before  t be long as henry s late presaging prophecydid glad my heart with hope of this young richmond so doth my heart misgive me  in these conflictswhat may befall him  to his harm and ours therefore  lord oxford  to prevent the worst forthwith we ll send him hence to brittany till storms be past of civil enmity oxford ay  for if edward repossess the crown  tis like that richmond with the rest shall

slept whose top branch overpeer d jove s spreading treeand kept low shrubs from winter s powerful wind these eyes  that now are dimm d with death s black veil have been as piercing as the mid day sun to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows  now filled with blood were liken d oft to kingly sepulchres for who lived king  but i could dig his grave and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow lo  now my glory smear d in dust and blood my parks  my walks  my manors that i had even now forsake me  and of all my landsis nothing left me but my body s length why  what is

fardel  heard the oldshepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon  after a little amazedness  we were allcommanded out of the chamber  only this methought iheard the shepherd say  he found the child autolycus i would most gladly know the issue of it first gentleman i make a broken delivery of the business  but thechanges i perceived in the king and camillo werevery notes of admiration  they seemed almost  withstaring on one another  to tear the cases of theireyes  there was speech in their dumbness  languagein their very gesture  they looked as they had heardof a world ransomed  or one destroyed  a notablepassion of wonder appeared in them  but the wisestbeholder  that knew no more but seeing  could notsay if the importance were joy or sorrow  but in theextremity of the one  it must needs be here comes a gentleman that haply knows more the news  rogero second gentleman nothing but bonfires  the oracle is fulfilled  theking s daughter is found  such a deal of wonder isbroken out within this hour that ballad makerscannot be able to express it here comes the lady paulina s steward  he candeliver you more  how goes it now  sir  this newswhich is called true is so like an old tale  thatthe verity of it is in strong suspicion  has the kingfound his heir third gentleman most true  if ever truth were pregnant bycircumstance  that which you hear you ll swear yousee  there is such unity in the proofs  the mantleof queen hermione s  her jewel about the neck of it the letters of antigonus found with it which theyknow to be his character  the majesty of thecreature in resemblance of the mother  the affectionof nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with allcertainty to be the king s daughter  did you seethe meeting of the two kings second gentleman no third gentleman then have you lost a sight  which was to be seen cannot be spoken of  there might you have beheld onejoy crown another  so and in such manner that itseemed sorrow wept to take leave of them  for theirjoy waded in tears  there was casting up of eyes holding up of hands  with countenances of suchdistraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour  our king  being ready to leap out ofhimself for joy of his found daughter  as if thatjoy were now become a loss  cries  o  thy mother thy mother   then asks bohemia forgiveness  thenembraces his son in law  then again worries he hisdaughter with clipping her  now he thanks the oldshepherd  which stands by like a weather bittenconduit of many kings  reigns  i never heard of suchanother encounter  which lames report to follow itand undoes description to do it second gentleman what  pray you  became of antigonus  that carriedhence the child third gentleman like an old tale still  which will have matter torehearse  though credit be asleep and not an earopen  he was torn to pieces with a bear  thisavouches the shepherd s son  who has not only hisinnocence  which seems much  to justify him  but ahandkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows first gentleman what became of his bark and his followers third gentleman wrecked the same instant of their master s death andin the view of the shepherd  so that all theinstruments which aided to expose the child wereeven then lost when it was found  but o  the noblecombat that  twixt joy and sorrow was fought inpaulina  she had one eye declined for the loss ofher husband  another elevated that the oracle wasfulfilled  she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing  as if she would pinher to her heart that she might no more be in dangerof losing first gentleman the dignity of this act was worth the audience ofkings and princes  for by such was it acted third gentleman one of the prettiest touches of all and that whichangled for mine eyes  caught the water though notthe fish  was when  at the relation of the queen sdeath  with the manner how she came to t bravelyconfessed and lamented by the king  howattentiveness wounded his daughter  till  from onesign of dolour to another  she did  with an  alas  i would fain say  bleed tears  for i am sure myheart wept blood  who was most marble there changedcolour  some swooned  all sorrowed  if all the worldcould have seen  t  the woe had been universal first gentleman are they returned to the court third gentleman no  the princess hearing of her mother s statue which is in the keeping of paulina   a piece manyyears in doing and now newly performed by that rareitalian master  julio romano  who  had he himselfeternity and could put breath into his work  wouldbeguile nature of her custom  so perfectly he is herape  he so near to hermione hath done hermione thatthey say one would speak to her and stand in hope ofanswer  thither with all greediness of affectionare they gone  and there they intend to sup second gentleman i thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day  eversince the death of hermione  visited that removedhouse  shall we thither and with our company piecethe rejoicing first gentleman who would be thence that has the benefit of access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge let s along autolycus now  had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head  i brought the

sway i will  as  twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people  therefore  i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct mehow i may formally in person bear melike a true friar  more reasons for this actionat our more leisure shall i render you only  this one  lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy  scarce confessesthat his blood flows  or that his appetiteis more to

of an infinite distancefrom his true meant design  upon his place and with full line of his authority governs lord angelo  a man whose bloodis very snow broth  one who never feelsthe wanton stings and motions of the sense but doth rebate and blunt his natural edgewith profits of the mind  study and fast he  to give fear to use and liberty which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lions  hath pick d out an act under whose heavy sense your brother s lifefalls into forfeit  he arrests him on it and follows close the rigour of the statute to make him an example  all hope is gone unless

words whilst my invention  hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel  heaven in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evilof my conception  the state  whereon i studiedis like a good thing  being often read grown fear d and tedious  yea  my gravity wherein  let no man hear me  i take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain  o place  o form how often dost thou with thy case  thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser soulsto thy false seeming  blood  thou art blood let s write good angel on the devil s horn  tis not the devil s crest how now  who s there servant one isabel  a sister  desires access to you angelo teach her the way o heavens why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other partsof necessary fitness so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him  and so stop the airby which he should revive  and even sothe general  subject to a well wish d king quit their own part  and in obsequious fondnesscrowd to his presence  where their untaught lovemust needs appear offence how now  fair maid isabella i am come to know your pleasure angelo that you might know it  would much better please methan to demand what  tis  your brother cannot live isabella even so  heaven keep your honour angelo yet may he live awhile  and  it may be as long as you or i yet he must die isabella under your sentence angelo yea isabella when  i beseech you  that in his reprieve longer or shorter  he may be so fittedthat his soul sicken not angelo ha  fie  these filthy vices  it were as goodto pardon him that hath from nature stolena man already made  as to remittheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven s imagein stamps that are forbid   tis all as easyfalsely to take away a life true madeas to put metal in restrained meansto make a false one isabella  tis set down so in heaven  but not in earth angelo say you so  then i shall pose you quickly which had you rather  that the most just lawnow took your brother s life  or  to redeem him give up your body to such sweet uncleannessas she that he hath stain d isabella sir  believe this i had rather give my body than my soul angelo i talk not of your soul  our compell d sinsstand more for number than for accompt isabella how say you angelo nay  i ll not warrant that  for i can speakagainst the thing i say  answer to this i  now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brother s life might there not be a charity in sinto save this brother s life isabella please you to do t i ll take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all  but charity angelo pleased you to do t at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity isabella that i do beg his life  if it be sin heaven let me bear it  you granting of my suit if that be sin  i ll make it my morn prayerto have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer angelo nay  but hear me your sense pursues not mine  either you are ignorant or seem so craftily  and that s not good isabella let me be ignorant  and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better angelo thus wisdom wishes to appear most brightwhen it doth tax itself  as these black masksproclaim an enshield beauty ten times louderthan beauty could  display d  but mark me to be received plain  i ll speak more gross your brother is to die isabella so angelo and his offence is so  as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain isabella true angelo admit no other way to save his life   as i subscribe not that  nor any other but in the loss of question   that you  his sister finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge  or own great place could fetch your brother from the manaclesof the all building law  and that there wereno earthly mean to save him  but that eitheryou must lay down the treasures of your bodyto this supposed  or else to let him suffer what would you do isabella as much for my poor brother as myself that is  were i under the terms of death the impression of keen whips i ld wear as rubies and strip myself to death  as to a bedthat longing have been sick for  ere i ld yieldmy body up to shame angelo then must your brother die isabella and  twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister  by redeeming him should die for ever angelo were not you then as cruel as the sentencethat you have slander d so isabella ignomy in ransom and free pardonare of two houses  lawful mercyis nothing kin to foul redemption angelo you seem d of late to make the law a tyrant and rather proved the sliding of your brothera merriment than a vice isabella o  pardon me  my lord  it oft falls out to have what we would have  we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love angelo we are all frail isabella else let my brother die if not a feodary  but only heowe and succeed thy weakness angelo nay  women are frail too isabella ay  as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms women  help heaven  men their creation marin profiting by them  nay  call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints angelo i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex   since i suppose we are made to be no strongerthan faults may shake our frames   let me be bold i do arrest your words  be that you are that is  a woman  if you be more  you re none if you be one  as you are well express dby all external warrants  show it now by putting on the destined livery isabella i have no tongue but one  gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language angelo plainly conceive  i love you isabella my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for it angelo he shall not  isabel  if you give me love isabella i know your virtue hath a licence in t which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others angelo believe me  on mine honour my words express my purpose isabella ha  little honour to be much believed and most pernicious purpose  seeming  seeming i will proclaim thee  angelo  look for t sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretch d throat i ll tell the world aloudwhat man thou art angelo who will believe thee  isabel my unsoil d name  the austereness of my life my vouch against you  and my place i  the state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own reportand smell of calumny  i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for  redeem thy brotherby yielding up thy

course of justice angelo and she will speak most bitterly and strange isabella most strange  but yet most truly  will i speak that angelo s forsworn  is it not strange that angelo s a murderer  is  t not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite  a virgin violator is it not strange and strange duke vincentio nay  it is ten times strange isabella it is not truer he is angelothan this is all as true as it is strange nay  it is ten times true  for truth is truthto the end of reckoning duke vincentio away with her  poor soul she speaks this in the infirmity of sense isabella o prince

begin with grief and shame to utter he would not  but by gift of my chaste bodyto his concupiscible intemperate lust release my brother  and  after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour and i did yield to him  but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting  he sends a warrantfor my poor brother s head duke vincentio this is most likely isabella o  that it were as like as it

the other side o' the cityis risen: why stay we prating here? to the capitol!all:come, come.first citizen:soft! who comes here?second citizen:worthy menenius agrippa; one that hath always lovedthe people.first citizen:he's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!menenius:what work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go youwith bats and clubs? the matter? speak, i pray you.first citizen:our business is not unknown to the senate; they havehad inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,which now we'll show 'em in deeds. they say poorsuitors have strong breaths: they shall know wehave strong arms too.menenius:why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,will you undo yourselves?first citizen:we cannot, sir, we are undone already.menenius:i tell you, friends, most charitable carehave the patricians of you. for your wants,your suffering in this dearth, you may as wellstrike at the heaven with your staves as lift themagainst the roman state, whose course will onthe way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbsof more strong link asunder than can everappear in your impediment. for the dearth,the gods, not the patricians, make it, andyour knees to them, not arms, must help. alack,you are transported by calamitythither where more attends you, and you slanderthe helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,when you curse them as enemies.first citizen:care for us! true, indeed! they ne'er cared for usyet: suffer us to famish, and their store-housescrammed with grain; make edicts for usury, tosupport usurers; repeal daily any wholesome actestablished against the rich, and provide morepiercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrainthe poor. if the wars eat us not up, they will; andthere's all the love they bear us.menenius:either you mustconfess yourselves wondrous malicious,or be accused of folly. i shall tell youa pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;but, since it serves my purpose, i will ventureto stale 't a little more.first citizen:well, i'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think tofob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't pleaseyou, deliver.menenius:there was a time when all the body's membersrebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:that only like a gulf it did remaini' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,still cupboarding the viand, never bearinglike labour with the rest, where the other instrumentsdid see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,and, mutually participate, did ministerunto the appetite and affection commonof the whole body. the belly answer'd--first citizen:well, sir, what answer made the belly?menenius:sir, i shall tell you. with a kind of smile,which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--for, look you, i may make the belly smileas well as speak--it tauntingly repliedto the discontented members, the mutinous partsthat envied his receipt; even so most fitlyas you malign our senators for thatthey are not such as you.first citizen:your belly's answer? what!the kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,the counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.with other muniments and petty helpsin this our fabric, if that they--menenius:what then?'fore me, this fellow speaks! what then? what then?first citizen:should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,who is the sink o' the body,--menenius:well, what then?first citizen:the former agents, if they did complain,what could the belly answer?menenius:i will tell youif you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.first citizen:ye're long about it.menenius:note me this, good friend;your most grave belly was deliberate,not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:'true is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,'that i receive the general food at first,which you do live upon; and fit it is,because i am the store-house and the shopof the whole body: but, if you do remember,i send it through the rivers of your blood,even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;and, through the cranks and offices of man,the strongest nerves and small inferior veinsfrom me receive that natural competencywhereby they live: and though that all at once,you, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--first citizen:ay, sir; well, well.menenius:'though all at once cannotsee what i do deliver out to each,yet i can make my audit up, that allfrom me do back receive the flour of all,and leave me but the bran.' what say you to't?first citizen:it was an answer: how apply you this?menenius:the senators of rome are this good belly,and you the mutinous members; for examinetheir counsels and their cares, digest things rightlytouching the weal o' the common, you shall findno public benefit which you receivebut it proceeds or comes from them to youand no way from yourselves. what do you think,you, the great toe of this assembly?first citizen:i the great toe! why the great toe?menenius:for that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,lead'st first to win some vantage.but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:rome and her rats are at the point of battle;the one side must have bale.hail, noble marcius!marcius:thanks. what's the matter, you dissentious rogues,that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,make yourselves scabs?first citizen:we have ever your good word.marcius:he that will give good words to thee will flatterbeneath abhorring. what would you have, you curs,that like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,the other makes you proud. he that trusts to you,where he should find you lions, finds you hares;where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,than is the coal of fire upon the ice,or hailstone in the sun. your virtue isto make him worthy whose offence subdues himand curse that justice did it.who deserves greatnessdeserves your hate; and your affections area sick man's appetite, who desires most thatwhich would increase his evil. he that dependsupon your favours swims with fins of leadand hews down oaks with rushes. hang ye! trust ye?with every minute you do change a mind,and call him noble that was now your hate,him vile that was your garland. what's the matter,that in these several places of the cityyou cry against the noble senate, who,under the gods, keep you in awe, which elsewould feed on one another? what's their seeking?menenius:for corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,the city is well stored.marcius:hang 'em! they say!they'll sit by the fire, and presume to knowwhat's done i' the capitol; who's like to rise,who thrives and who declines; side factionsand give outconjectural marriages; making parties strongand feebling such as stand not in their likingbelow their cobbled shoes. they say there'sgrain enough!would the nobility lay aside their ruth,and let me use my sword, i'll make a quarrywith thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as highas i could pick my lance.menenius:nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;for though abundantly they lack discretion,yet are they passing cowardly. but, i beseech you,what says the other troop?marcius:they are dissolved: hang 'em!they said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,that hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,that meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent notcorn for the rich men only: with these shredsthey vented their complainings; which being answer'd,and a petition granted them, a strange one--to break the heart of generosity,and make bold power look pale--they threw their capsas they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,shouting their emulation.menenius:what is granted them?marcius:five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,of their own choice: one's junius brutus,sicinius velutus, and i know not--'sdeath!the rabble should have first unroof'd the city,ere so prevail'd with me: it will in timewin upon power and throw forth greater themesfor insurrection's arguing.menenius:this is strange.marcius:go, get you home, you fragments!messenger:where's caius marcius?marcius:here: what's the matter?messenger:the news is, sir, the volsces are in arms.marcius:i am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to ventour musty superfluity. see, our best elders.first senator:marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;the volsces are in arms.marcius:they have a leader,tullus aufidius, that will put you to 't.i sin in envying his nobility,and were i any thing but what i am,i would wish me only he.cominius:you have fought together.marcius:were half to half the world by the ears and he.upon my party, i'ld revolt to makeonly my wars with him: he is a lionthat i am proud to hunt.first senator:then, worthy marcius,attend upon cominius to these wars.cominius:it is your former promise.marcius:sir, it is;and i am constant. titus lartius, thoushalt see me once more strike at tullus' face.what, art thou stiff? stand'st out?titus:no, caius marcius;i'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,ere stay behind this business.menenius:o, true-bred!first senator:your company to the capitol; where, i know,our greatest friends attend us.titus:cominius:noble marcius!first senator:marcius:nay, let them follow:the volsces have much corn; take these rats thitherto gnaw their garners. worshipful mutiners,your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.sicinius:was ever man so proud as is this marcius?brutus:he has no equal.sicinius:when we were chosen tribunes for the people,--brutus:mark'd you his lip and eyes?sicinius:nay. but his taunts.brutus:being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.sicinius:be-mock the modest moon.brutus:the present wars devour him: he is growntoo proud to be so valiant.sicinius:such a nature,tickled with good success, disdains the shadowwhich he treads on at noon: but i do wonderhis insolence can brook to be commandedunder cominius.brutus:fame, at the which he aims,in whom already he's well graced, can notbetter be held nor more attain'd than bya place below the first: for what miscarriesshall be the general's fault, though he performto the utmost of a man, and giddy censurewill then cry out of marcius 'o if hehad borne the business!'sicinius:besides, if things go well,opinion that so sticks on marcius shallof his demerits rob cominius.brutus:come:half all cominius' honours are to marcius.though marcius earned them not, and all his faultsto marcius shall be honours, though indeedin aught he merit not.sicinius:let's hence, and hearhow the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,more than his singularity, he goesupon this present action.brutus:lets along.first senator:so, your opinion is, aufidius,that they of rome are entered in our counselsand know how we proceed.aufidius:is it not yours?what ever have been thought on in this state,that could be brought to bodily act ere romehad circumvention? 'tis not four days gonesince i heard thence; these are the words: i thinki have the letter here; yes, here it is.'they have press'd a power, but it is not knownwhether for east or west: the dearth is great;the people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,cominius, marcius your old enemy,who is of rome worse hated than of you,and titus lartius, a most valiant roman,these three lead on this preparationwhither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:consider of it.'first senator:our army's in the fieldwe never yet made doubt but rome was readyto answer us.aufidius:nor did you think it follyto keep your great pretences veil'd till whenthey needs must show themselves; whichin the hatching,it seem'd, appear'd to rome. by the discovery.we shall be shorten'd in our aim, which wasto take in many towns ere almost romeshould know we were afoot.second senator:noble aufidius,take your commission; hie you to your bands:let us alone to guard corioli:if they set down before 's, for the removebring your army; but, i think, you'll findthey've not prepared for us.aufidius:o, doubt not that;i speak from certainties. nay, more,some parcels of their power are forth already,and only hitherward. i leave your honours.if we and caius marcius chance to meet,'tis sworn between us we shall ever striketill one can do no more.all:the gods assist you!aufidius:and keep your honours safe!first senator:farewell.second senator:farewell.all:farewell.volumnia:i pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in amore comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, ishould freelier rejoice in that absence wherein hewon honour than in the embracements of his bed wherehe would show most love. when yet he was buttender-bodied and the only son of my womb, whenyouth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, whenfor a day of kings' entreaties a mother should notsell him an hour from her beholding, i, consideringhow honour would become such a person. that it wasno better than picture-like to hang by the wall, ifrenown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seekdanger where he was like to find fame. to a cruelwar i sent him; from whence he returned, his browsbound with oak. i tell thee, daughter, i sprang notmore in joy at first hearing he was a man-childthan now in first seeing he had proved himself aman.virgilia:but had he died in the business, madam; how then?volumnia:then his good report should have been my son; itherein would have found issue. hear me professsincerely: had i a dozen sons, each in my lovealike and none less dear than thine and my goodmarcius, i had rather had eleven die nobly for theircountry than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.gentlewoman:madam, the lady valeria is come to visit you.virgilia:beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.volumnia:indeed, you shall not.methinks i hear hither your husband's drum,see him pluck aufidius down by the hair,as children from a bear, the volsces shunning him:methinks i see him stamp thus, and call thus:'come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,though you were born in rome:' his bloody browwith his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mowor all or lose his hire.virgilia:his bloody brow! o jupiter, no blood!volumnia:away, you fool! it more becomes a manthan gilt his trophy: the breasts of hecuba,when she did suckle hector, look'd not lovelierthan hector's forehead when it spit forth bloodat grecian sword, contemning. tell valeria,we are fit to bid her welcome.virgilia:heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius!volumnia:he'll beat aufidius 'head below his kneeand tread upon his neck.valeria:my ladies both, good day to you.volumnia:sweet madam.virgilia:i am glad to see your ladyship.valeria:how do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.what are you sewing here? a fine spot, in goodfaith. how does your little son?virgilia:i thank your ladyship; well, good madam.volumnia:he had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, thanlook upon his school-master.valeria:o' my word, the father's son: i'll swear,'tis avery pretty boy. o' my troth, i looked upon him o'wednesday half an hour together: has such aconfirmed countenance. i saw him run after a gildedbutterfly: and when he caught it, he let it goagain; and after it again; and over and over hecomes, and again; catched it again; or whether hisfall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set histeeth and tear it; o, i warrant it, how he mammockedit!volumnia:one on 's father's moods.valeria:indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.virgilia:a crack, madam.valeria:come, lay aside your stitchery; i must have you playthe idle husewife with me this afternoon.virgilia:no, good madam; i will not out of doors.valeria:not out of doors!volumnia:she shall, she shall.virgilia:indeed, no, by your patience; i'll not over thethreshold till my lord return from the wars.valeria:fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,you must go visit the good lady that lies in.virgilia:i will wish her speedy strength, and visit her withmy prayers; but i cannot go thither.volumnia:why, i pray you?virgilia:'tis not to save labour, nor that i want love.valeria:you would be another penelope: yet, they say, allthe yarn she spun in ulysses' absence did but fillithaca full of moths. come; i would your cambricwere sensible as your finger, that you might leavepricking it for pity. come, you shall go with us.virgilia:no, good madam, pardon me; indeed, i will not forth.valeria:in truth, la, go with me; and i'll tell youexcellent news of your husband.virgilia:o, good madam, there can be none yet.valeria:verily, i do not jest with you; there came news fromhim last night.virgilia:indeed, madam?valeria:in earnest, it's true; i heard a senator speak it.thus it is: the volsces have an army forth; againstwhom cominius the general is gone, with one part ofour roman power: your lord and titus lartius are setdown before their city corioli; they nothing doubtprevailing and to make it brief wars. this is true,on mine honour; and so, i pray, go with us.virgilia:give me excuse, good madam; i will obey you in everything hereafter.volumnia:let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will butdisease our better mirth.valeria:in troth, i think she would. fare you well, then.come, good sweet lady. prithee, virgilia, turn thysolemness out o' door. and go along with us.virgilia:no, at a word, madam; indeed, i must not. i wishyou much mirth.valeria:well, then, farewell.marcius:yonder comes news. a wager they have met.lartius:my horse to yours, no.marcius:'tis done.lartius:agreed.marcius:say, has our general met the enemy?messenger:they lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.lartius:so, the good horse is mine.marcius:i'll buy him of you.lartius:no, i'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him i willfor half a hundred years. summon the town.marcius:how far off lie these armies?messenger:within this mile and half.marcius:then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.now, mars, i prithee, make us quick in work,that we with smoking swords may march from hence,to help our fielded friends! come, blow thy blast.tutus aufidius, is he within your walls?first senator:no, nor a man that fears you less than he,that's lesser than a little.hark! our drumsare bringing forth our youth. we'll break our walls,rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;they'll open of themselves.hark you. far off!there is aufidius; list, what work he makesamongst your cloven army.marcius:o, they are at it!lartius:their noise be our instruction. ladders, ho!marcius:they fear us not, but issue forth their city.now put your shields before your hearts, and fightwith hearts more proof than shields. advance,brave titus:they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,which makes me sweat with wrath. come on, my fellows:he that retires i'll take him for a volsce,and he shall feel mine edge.marcius:all the contagion of the south light on you,you shames of rome! you herd of--boils and plaguesplaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'dfurther than seen and one infect anotheragainst the wind a mile! you souls of geese,that bear the shapes of men, how have you runfrom slaves that apes would beat! pluto and hell!all hurt behind; backs red, and faces palewith flight and agued fear! mend and charge home,or, by the fires of heaven, i'll leave the foeand make my wars on you: look to't: come on;if you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,as they us to our trenches followed.so, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:'tis for the followers fortune widens them,not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.first soldier:fool-hardiness; not i.second soldier:nor i.first soldier:see, they have shut him in.all:to the pot, i warrant him.lartius:what is become of marcius?all:slain, sir, doubtless.first soldier:following the fliers at the very heels,with them he enters; who, upon the sudden,clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,to answer all the city.lartius:o noble fellow!who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,and, when it bows, stands up. thou art left, marcius:a carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,were not so rich a jewel. thou wast a soldiereven to cato's wish, not fierce and terribleonly in strokes; but, with thy grim looks andthe thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the worldwere feverous and did tremble.first soldier:look, sir.lartius:o,'tis marcius!let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.first roman:this will i carry to rome.second roman:and i this.third roman:a murrain on't! i took this for silver.marcius:see here these movers that do prize their hoursat a crack'd drachm! cushions, leaden spoons,irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen wouldbury with those that wore them, these base slaves,ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!and hark, what noise the general makes! to him!there is the man of my soul's hate, aufidius,piercing our romans: then, valiant titus, takeconvenient numbers to make good the city;whilst i, with those that have the spirit, will hasteto help cominius.lartius:worthy sir, thou bleed'st;thy exercise hath been too violent fora second course of fight.marcius:sir, praise me not;my work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:the blood i drop is rather physicalthan dangerous to me: to aufidius thusi will appear, and fight.lartius:now the fair goddess, fortune,fall deep in love with thee; and her great charmsmisguide thy opposers' swords! bold gentleman,prosperity be thy page!marcius:thy friend no lessthan those she placeth highest! so, farewell.lartius:thou worthiest marcius!go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;call thither all the officers o' the town,where they shall know our mind: away!cominius:breathe you, my friends: well fought;we are come offlike romans, neither foolish in our stands,nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,we shall be charged again. whiles we have struck,by interims and conveying gusts we have heardthe charges of our friends. ye roman gods!lead their successes as we wish our own,that both our powers, with smilingfronts encountering,may give you thankful sacrifice.thy news?messenger:the citizens of corioli have issued,and given to lartius and to marcius battle:i saw our party to their trenches driven,and then i came away.cominius:though thou speak'st truth,methinks thou speak'st not well.how long is't since?messenger:above an hour, my lord.cominius:'tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,and bring thy news so late?messenger:spies of the volscesheld me in chase, that i was forced to wheelthree or four miles about, else had i, sir,half an hour since brought my report.cominius:who's yonder,that does appear as he were flay'd? o godshe has the stamp of marcius; and i havebefore-time seen him thus.marcius:cominius:the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabourmore than i know the sound of marcius' tonguefrom every meaner man.marcius:come i too late?cominius:ay, if you come not in the blood of others,but mantled in your own.marcius:o, let me clip yein arms as sound as when i woo'd, in heartas merry as when our nuptial day was done,and tapers burn'd to bedward!cominius:flower of warriors,how is it with titus lartius?marcius:as with a man busied about decrees:condemning some to death, and some to exile;ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;holding corioli in the name of rome,even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,to let him slip at will.cominius:where is that slavewhich told me they had beat you to your trenches?where is he? call him hither.marcius:let him alone;he did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,the common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--the mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budgefrom rascals worse than they.cominius:but how prevail'd you?marcius:will the time serve to tell? i do not think.where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?if not, why cease you till you are so?cominius:marcius,we have at disadvantage fought and didretire to win our purpose.marcius:how lies their battle? know you on which sidethey have placed their men of trust?cominius:as i guess, marcius,their bands i' the vaward are the antiates,of their best trust; o'er them aufidius,their very heart of hope.marcius:i do beseech you,by all the battles wherein we have fought,by the blood we have shed together, by the vowswe have made to endure friends, that you directlyset me against aufidius and his antiates;and that you not delay the present, but,filling the air with swords advanced and darts,we prove this very hour.cominius:though i could wishyou were conducted to a gentle bathand balms applied to, you, yet dare i neverdeny your asking: take your choice of thosethat best can aid your action.marcius:those are theythat most are willing. if any such be here--as it were sin to doubt--that love this paintingwherein you see me smear'd; if any fearlesser his person than an ill report;if any think brave death outweighs bad lifeand that his country's dearer than himself;let him alone, or so many so minded,wave thus, to express his disposition,and follow marcius.o, me alone! make you a sword of me?if these shows be not outward, which of youbut is four volsces? none of you but isable to bear against the great aufidiusa shield as hard as his. a certain number,though thanks to all, must i selectfrom all: the restshall bear the business in some other fight,as cause will be obey'd. please you to march;and four shall quickly draw out my command,which men are best inclined.cominius:march on, my fellows:make good this ostentation, and you shalldivide in all with us.lartius:so, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,as i have set them down. if i do send, dispatchthose centuries to our aid: the rest will servefor a short holding: if we lose the field,we cannot keep the town.lieutenant:fear not our care, sir.lartius:hence, and shut your gates upon's.our guider, come; to the roman camp conduct us.marcius:i'll fight with none but thee; for i do hate theeworse than a promise-breaker.aufidius:we hate alike:not afric owns a serpent i abhormore than thy fame and envy. fix thy foot.marcius:let the first budger die the other's slave,and the gods doom him after!aufidius:if i fly, marcius,holloa me like a hare.marcius:within these three hours, tullus,alone i fought in your corioli walls,and made what work i pleased: 'tis not my bloodwherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revengewrench up thy power to the highest.aufidius:wert thou the hectorthat was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,thou shouldst not scape me here.officious, and not valiant, you have shamed mein your condemned seconds.cominius:if i should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but i'll report itwhere senators shall mingle tears with smiles,where great patricians shall attend and shrug,i' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,and, gladly quaked, hear more; where thedull tribunes,that, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,shall say against their hearts 'we thank the godsour rome hath such a soldier.'yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,having fully dined before.lartius:o general,here is the steed, we the caparison:hadst thou beheld--marcius:pray now, no more: my mother,who has a charter to extol her blood,when she does praise me grieves me. i have doneas you have done; that's what i can; inducedas you have been; that's for my country:he that has but effected his good willhath overta'en mine act.cominius:you shall not bethe grave of your deserving; rome must knowthe value of her own: 'twere a concealmentworse than a theft, no less than a traducement,to hide your doings; and to silence that,which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,would seem but modest: therefore, i beseech youin sign of what you are, not to rewardwhat you have done--before our army hear me.marcius:i have some wounds upon me, and they smartto hear themselves remember'd.cominius:should they not,well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,and tent themselves with death. of all the horses,whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of allthe treasure in this field achieved and city,we render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,before the common distribution, atyour only choice.marcius:i thank you, general;but cannot make my heart consent to takea bribe to pay my sword: i do refuse it;and stand upon my common part with thosethat have beheld the doing.marcius:may these same instruments, which you profane,never sound more! when drums and trumpets shalli' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities bemade all of false-faced soothing!when steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,let him be made a coverture for the wars!no more, i say! for that i have not wash'dmy nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--which, without note, here's many else have done,--you shout me forthin acclamations hyperbolical;as if i loved my little should be dietedin praises sauced with lies.cominius:too modest are you;more cruel to your good report than gratefulto us that give you truly: by your patience,if 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,then reason safely with you. therefore, be it known,as to us, to all the world, that caius marciuswears this war's garland: in token of the which,my noble steed, known to the camp, i give him,with all his trim belonging; and from this time,for what he did before corioli, call him,with all the applause and clamour of the host,caius marcius coriolanus! bearthe addition nobly ever!all:caius marcius coriolanus!coriolanus:i will go wash;and when my face is fair, you shall perceivewhether i blush or no: howbeit, i thank you.i mean to stride your steed, and at all timesto undercrest your good additionto the fairness of my power.cominius:so, to our tent;where, ere we do repose us, we will writeto rome of our success. you, titus lartius,must to corioli back: send us to romethe best, with whom we may articulate,for their own good and ours.lartius:i shall, my lord.coriolanus:the gods begin to mock me. i, that nowrefused most princely gifts, am bound to begof my lord general.cominius:take't; 'tis yours. what is't?coriolanus:i sometime lay here in corioliat a poor man's house; he used me kindly:he cried to me; i saw him prisoner;but then aufidius was within my view,and wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: i request youto give my poor host freedom.cominius:o, well begg'd!were he the butcher of my son, he shouldbe free as is the wind. deliver him, titus.lartius:marcius, his name?coriolanus:by jupiter! forgot.i am weary; yea, my memory is tired.have we no wine here?cominius:go we to our tent:the blood upon your visage dries; 'tis timeit should be look'd to: come.aufidius:the town is ta'en!first soldier:'twill be deliver'd back on good condition.aufidius:condition!i would i were a roman; for i cannot,being a volsce, be that i am. condition!what good condition can a treaty findi' the part that is at mercy? five times, marcius,i have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,and wouldst do so, i think, should we encounteras often as we eat. by the elements,if e'er again i meet him beard to beard,he's mine, or i am his: mine emulationhath not that honour in't it had; for wherei thought to crush him in an equal force,true sword to sword, i'll potch at him some wayor wrath or craft may get him.first soldier:he's the devil.aufidius:bolder, though not so subtle. my valour's poison'dwith only suffering stain by him; for himshall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,being naked, sick, nor fane nor capitol,the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,embarquements all of fury, shall lift uptheir rotten privilege and custom 'gainstmy hate to marcius: where i find him, were itat home, upon my brother's guard, even there,against the hospitable canon, would iwash my fierce hand in's heart. go you to the city;learn how 'tis held; and what they are that mustbe hostages for rome.first soldier:will not you go?aufidius:i am attended at the cypress grove: i pray you--'tis south the city mills--bring me word thitherhow the world goes, that to the pace of iti may spur on my journey.first soldier:i shall, sir.menenius:the augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.brutus:good or bad?menenius:not according to the prayer of the people, for theylove not marcius.sicinius:nature teaches beasts to know their friends.menenius:pray you, who does the wolf love?sicinius:the lamb.menenius:ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would thenoble marcius.brutus:he's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.menenius:he's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. you twoare old men: tell me one thing that i shall ask you.both:well, sir.menenius:in what enormity is marcius poor in, that you twohave not in abundance?brutus:he's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.sicinius:especially in pride.brutus:and topping all others in boasting.menenius:this is strange now: do you two know how you arecensured here in the city, i mean of us o' theright-hand file? do you?both:why, how are we censured?menenius:because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?both:well, well, sir, well.menenius:why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief ofoccasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:give your dispositions the reins, and be angry atyour pleasures; at the least if you take it as apleasure to you in being so. you blame marcius forbeing proud?brutus:we do it not alone, sir.menenius:i know you can do very little alone; for your helpsare many, or else your actions would grow wondroussingle: your abilities are too infant-like fordoing much alone. you talk of pride: o that youcould turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,and make but an interior survey of your good selves!o that you could!brutus:what then, sir?menenius:why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, asany in rome.sicinius:menenius, you are known well enough too.menenius:i am known to be a humorous patrician, and one thatloves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allayingtiber in't; said to be something imperfect infavouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-likeupon too trivial motion; one that converses morewith the buttock of the night than with the foreheadof the morning: what i think i utter, and spend mymalice in my breath. meeting two such wealsmen asyou are--i cannot call you lycurguses--if the drinkyou give me touch my palate adversely, i make acrooked face at it. i can't say your worships havedelivered the matter well, when i find the ass incompound with the major part of your syllables: andthough i must be content to bear with those that sayyou are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly thattell you you have good faces. if you see this inthe map of my microcosm, follows it that i am knownwell enough too? what barm can your bissonconspectuities glean out of this character, if i beknown well enough too?brutus:come, sir, come, we know you well enough.menenius:you know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. youare ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: youwear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing acause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to asecond day of audience. when you are hearing amatter between party and party, if you chance to bepinched with the colic, you make faces likemummers; set up the bloody flag against allpatience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangledby your hearing: all the peace you make in theircause is, calling both the parties knaves. you area pair of strange ones.brutus:come, come, you are well understood to be aperfecter giber for the table than a necessarybencher in the capitol.menenius:our very priests must become mockers, if they shallencounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. whenyou speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth thewagging of your beards; and your beards deserve notso honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher'scushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-saddle. yet you must be saying, marcius is proud;who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessorssince deucalion, though peradventure some of thebest of 'em were hereditary hangmen. god-den toyour worships: more of your conversation wouldinfect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastlyplebeians: i will be bold to take my leave of you.how now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you followyour eyes so fast?volumnia:honourable menenius, my boy marcius approaches; forthe love of juno, let's go.menenius:ha! marcius coming home!volumnia:ay, worthy menenius; and with most prosperousapprobation.menenius:take my cap, jupiter, and i thank thee. hoo!marcius coming home!volumnia:nay,'tis true.volumnia:look, here's a letter from him: the state hathanother, his wife another; and, i think, there's oneat home for you.menenius:i will make my very house reel tonight: a letter forme!virgilia:yes, certain, there's a letter for you; i saw't.menenius:a letter for me! it gives me an estate of sevenyears' health; in which time i will make a lip atthe physician: the most sovereign prescription ingalen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,of no better report than a horse-drench. is henot wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.virgilia:o, no, no, no.volumnia:o, he is wounded; i thank the gods for't.menenius:so do i too, if it be not too much: brings a'victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.volumnia:on's brows: menenius, he comes the third time homewith the oaken garland.menenius:has he disciplined aufidius soundly?volumnia:titus lartius writes, they fought together, butaufidius got off.menenius:and 'twas time for him too, i'll warrant him that:an he had stayed by him, i would not have been sofidiused for all the chests in corioli, and the goldthat's in them. is the senate possessed of this?volumnia:good ladies, let's go. yes, yes, yes; the senatehas letters from the general, wherein he gives myson the whole name of the war: he hath in thisaction outdone his former deeds doublyvaleria:in troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.menenius:wondrous! ay, i warrant you, and not without histrue purchasing.virgilia:the gods grant them true!volumnia:true! pow, wow.menenius:true! i'll be sworn they are true.where is he wounded?god save your good worships! marcius is cominghome: he has more cause to be proud. where is he wounded?volumnia:i' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will belarge cicatrices to show the people, when he shallstand for his place. he received in the repulse oftarquin seven hurts i' the body.menenius:one i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there'snine that i know.volumnia:he had, before this last expedition, twenty-fivewounds upon him.menenius:now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.hark! the trumpets.volumnia:these are the ushers of marcius: before him hecarries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.herald:know, rome, that all alone marcius did fightwithin corioli gates: where he hath won,with fame, a name to caius marcius; thesein honour follows coriolanus.welcome to rome, renowned coriolanus!all:welcome to rome, renowned coriolanus!coriolanus:no more of this; it does offend my heart:pray now, no more.cominius:look, sir, your mother!coriolanus:o,you have, i know, petition'd all the godsfor my prosperity!volumnia:nay, my good soldier, up;my gentle marcius, worthy caius, andby deed-achieving honour newly named,--what is it?--coriolanus must i call thee?--but o, thy wife!coriolanus:my gracious silence, hail!wouldst thou have laugh'd had i come coffin'd home,that weep'st to see me triumph? ay, my dear,such eyes the widows in corioli wear,and mothers that lack sons.menenius:now, the gods crown thee!coriolanus:and live you yet?o my sweet lady, pardon.volumnia:i know not where to turn: o, welcome home:and welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.menenius:a hundred thousand welcomes. i could weepand i could laugh, i am light and heavy. welcome.a curse begin at very root on's heart,that is not glad to see thee! you are threethat rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,we have some old crab-trees hereat home that will notbe grafted to your relish. yet welcome, warriors:we call a nettle but a nettle andthe faults of fools but folly.cominius:ever right.coriolanus:menenius ever, ever.herald:give way there, and go on!coriolanus:volumnia:i have livedto see inherited my very wishesand the buildings of my fancy: onlythere's one thing wanting, which i doubt not butour rome will cast upon thee.coriolanus:know, good mother,i had rather be their servant in my way,than sway with them in theirs.cominius:on, to the capitol!brutus:all tongues speak of him, and the bleared sightsare spectacled to see him: your prattling nurseinto a rapture lets her baby crywhile she chats him: the kitchen malkin pinsher richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsedwith variable complexions, all agreeingin earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamensdo press among the popular throngs and puffto win a vulgar station: or veil'd damescommit the war of white and damask intheir nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoilof phoebus' burning kisses: such a potheras if that whatsoever god who leads himwere slily crept into his human powersand gave him graceful posture.sicinius:on the sudden,i warrant him consul.brutus:then our office may,during his power, go sleep.sicinius:he cannot temperately transport his honoursfrom where he should begin and end, but willlose those he hath won.brutus:in that there's comfort.sicinius:doubt notthe commoners, for whom we stand, but theyupon their ancient malice will forgetwith the least cause these his new honours, whichthat he will give them make i as little questionas he is proud to do't.brutus:i heard him swear,were he to stand for consul, never would heappear i' the market-place nor on him putthe napless vesture of humility;nor showing, as the manner is, his woundsto the people, beg their stinking breaths.sicinius:'tis right.brutus:it was his word: o, he would miss it ratherthan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,and the desire of the nobles.sicinius:i wish no betterthan have him hold that purpose and to put itin execution.brutus:'tis most like he will.sicinius:it shall be to him then as our good wills,a sure destruction.brutus:so it must fall outto him or our authorities. for an end,we must suggest the people in what hatredhe still hath held them; that to's power he wouldhave made them mules, silenced their pleaders anddispropertied their freedoms, holding them,in human action and capacity,of no more soul nor fitness for the worldthan camels in the war, who have their provandonly for bearing burdens, and sore blowsfor sinking under them.sicinius:this, as you say, suggestedat some time when his soaring insolenceshall touch the people--which time shall not want,if he be put upon 't; and that's as easyas to set dogs on sheep--will be his fireto kindle their dry stubble; and their blazeshall darken him for ever.brutus:what's the matter?messenger:you are sent for to the capitol. 'tis thoughtthat marcius shall be consul:i have seen the dumb men throng to see him andthe blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,as to jove's statue, and the commons madea shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:i never saw the like.brutus:let's to the capitol;and carry with us ears and eyes for the time,but hearts for the event.sicinius:have with you.first officer:come, come, they are almost here. how many standfor consulships?second officer:three, they say: but 'tis thought of every onecoriolanus will carry it.first officer:that's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, andloves not the common people.second officer:faith, there had been many great men that haveflattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and therebe many that they have loved, they know notwherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, forcoriolanus neither to care whether they love or hatehim manifests the true knowledge he has in theirdisposition; and out of his noble carelessness letsthem plainly see't.first officer:if he did not care whether he had their love or no,he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neithergood nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greaterdevotion than can render it him; and leavesnothing undone that may fully discover him theiropposite. now, to seem to affect the malice anddispleasure of the people is as bad as that which hedislikes, to flatter them for their love.second officer:he hath deserved worthily of his country: and hisascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,having been supple and courteous to the people,bonneted, without any further deed to have them atan into their estimation and report: but he hath soplanted his honours in their eyes, and his actionsin their hearts, that for their tongues to besilent, and not confess so much, were a kind ofingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were amalice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluckreproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.first officer:no more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, theyare coming.menenius:having determined of the volsces andto send for titus lartius, it remains,as the main point of this our after-meeting,to gratify his noble service thathath thus stood for his country: therefore,please you,most reverend and grave elders, to desirethe present consul, and last generalin our well-found successes, to reporta little of that worthy work perform'dby caius marcius coriolanus, whomwe met here both to thank and to rememberwith honours like himself.first senator:speak, good cominius:leave nothing out for length, and make us thinkrather our state's defective for requitalthan we to stretch it out.masters o' the people,we do request your kindest ears, and after,your loving motion toward the common body,to yield what passes here.sicinius:we are conventedupon a pleasing treaty, and have heartsinclinable to honour and advancethe theme of our assembly.brutus:which the ratherwe shall be blest to do, if he remembera kinder value of the people thanhe hath hereto prized them at.menenius:that's off, that's off;i would you rather had been silent. please youto hear cominius speak?brutus:most willingly;but yet my caution was more pertinentthan the rebuke you give it.menenius:he loves your peoplebut tie him not to be their bedfellow.worthy cominius, speak.nay, keep your place.first senator:sit, coriolanus; never shame to hearwhat you have nobly done.coriolanus:your horror's pardon:i had rather have my wounds to heal againthan hear say how i got them.brutus:sir, i hopemy words disbench'd you not.coriolanus:no, sir: yet oft,when blows have made me stay, i fled from words.you soothed not, therefore hurt not: butyour people,i love them as they weigh.menenius:pray now, sit down.coriolanus:i had rather have one scratch my head i' the sunwhen the alarum were struck than idly sitto hear my nothings monster'd.menenius:masters of the people,your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--that's thousand to one good one--when you now seehe had rather venture all his limbs for honourthan one on's ears to hear it? proceed, cominius.cominius:i shall lack voice: the deeds of coriolanusshould not be utter'd feebly. it is heldthat valour is the chiefest virtue, andmost dignifies the haver: if it be,the man i speak of cannot in the worldbe singly counterpoised. at sixteen years,when tarquin made a head for rome, he foughtbeyond the mark of others: our then dictator,whom with all praise i point at, saw him fight,when with his amazonian chin he drovethe bristled lips before him: be bestridan o'er-press'd roman and i' the consul's viewslew three opposers: tarquin's self he met,and struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,when he might act the woman in the scene,he proved best man i' the field, and for his meedwas brow-bound with the oak. his pupil ageman-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,and in the brunt of seventeen battles sincehe lurch'd all swords of the garland. for this last,before and in corioli, let me say,i cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;and by his rare example made the cowardturn terror into sport: as weeds beforea vessel under sail, so men obey'dand fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,where it did mark, it took; from face to foothe was a thing of blood, whose every motionwas timed with dying cries: alone he enter'dthe mortal gate of the city, which he paintedwith shunless destiny; aidless came off,and with a sudden reinforcement struckcorioli like a planet: now all's his:when, by and by, the din of war gan piercehis ready sense; then straight his doubled spiritre-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,and to the battle came he; where he didrun reeking o'er the lives of men, as if'twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'dboth field and city ours, he never stoodto ease his breast with panting.menenius:worthy man!first senator:he cannot but with measure fit the honourswhich we devise him.cominius:our spoils he kick'd at,and look'd upon things precious as they werethe common muck of the world: he covets lessthan misery itself would give; rewardshis deeds with doing them, and is contentto spend the time to end it.menenius:he's right noble:let him be call'd for.first senator:call coriolanus.officer:he doth appear.menenius:the senate, coriolanus, are well pleasedto make thee consul.coriolanus:i do owe them stillmy life and services.menenius:it then remainsthat you do speak to the people.coriolanus:i do beseech you,let me o'erleap that custom, for i cannotput on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,for my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please youthat i may pass this doing.sicinius:sir, the peoplemust have their voices; neither will they bateone jot of ceremony.menenius:put them not to't:pray you, go fit you to the custom andtake to you, as your predecessors have,your honour with your form.coriolanus:it is apartthat i shall blush in acting, and might wellbe taken from the people.brutus:mark you that?coriolanus:to brag unto them, thus i did, and thus;show them the unaching scars which i should hide,as if i had received them for the hireof their breath only!menenius:do not stand upon't.we recommend to you, tribunes of the people,our purpose to them: and to our noble consulwish we all joy and honour.senators:to coriolanus come all joy and honour!brutus:you see how he intends to use the people.sicinius:may they perceive's intent! he will require them,as if he did contemn what he requestedshould be in them to give.brutus:come, we'll inform themof our proceedings here: on the marketplace,i know, they do attend us.first citizen:once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.second citizen:we may, sir, if we will.third citizen:we have power in ourselves to do it, but it is apower that we have no power to do; for if he show ushis wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put ourtongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, ifhe tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell himour noble acceptance of them. ingratitude ismonstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,were to make a monster of the multitude: of thewhich we being members, should bring ourselves to bemonstrous members.first citizen:and to make us no better thought of, a little helpwill serve; for once we stood up about the corn, hehimself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.third citizen:we have been called so of many; not that our headsare some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,but that our wits are so diversely coloured: andtruly i think if all our wits were to issue out ofone skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,and their consent of one direct way should be atonce to all the points o' the compass.second citizen:think you so? which way do you judge my wit wouldfly?third citizen:nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man'swill;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, butif it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.second citizen:why that way?third citizen:to lose itself in a fog, where being three partsmelted away with rotten dews, the fourth would returnfor conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.second citizen:you are never without your tricks: you may, you may.third citizen:are you all resolved to give your voices? butthat's no matter, the greater part carries it. isay, if he would incline to the people, there wasnever a worthier man.here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark hisbehavior. we are not to stay all together, but tocome by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, andby threes. he's to make his requests byparticulars; wherein every one of us has a singlehonour, in giving him our own voices with our owntongues: therefore follow me, and i direct you howyou shall go by him.all:content, content.menenius:o sir, you are not right: have you not knownthe worthiest men have done't?coriolanus:what must i say?'i pray, sir'--plague upon't! i cannot bringmy tongue to such a pace:--'look, sir, my wounds!i got them in my country's service, whensome certain of your brethren roar'd and ranfrom the noise of our own drums.'menenius:o me, the gods!you must not speak of that: you must desire themto think upon you.coriolanus:think upon me! hang 'em!i would they would forget me, like the virtueswhich our divines lose by 'em.menenius:you'll mar all:i'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, i pray you,in wholesome manner.coriolanus:bid them wash their facesand keep their teeth clean.so, here comes a brace.you know the cause, air, of my standing here.third citizen:we do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.coriolanus:mine own desert.second citizen:your own desert!coriolanus:ay, but not mine own desire.third citizen:how not your own desire?coriolanus:no, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble thepoor with begging.third citizen:you must think, if we give you any thing, we hope togain by you.coriolanus:well then, i pray, your price o' the consulship?first citizen:the price is to ask it kindly.coriolanus:kindly! sir, i pray, let me ha't: i have wounds toshow you, which shall be yours in private. yourgood voice, sir; what say you?second citizen:you shall ha' it, worthy sir.coriolanus:a match, sir. there's in all two worthy voicesbegged. i have your alms: adieu.third citizen:but this is something odd.second citizen:an 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.coriolanus:pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of yourvoices that i may be consul, i have here thecustomary gown.fourth citizen:you have deserved nobly of your country, and youhave not deserved nobly.coriolanus:your enigma?fourth citizen:you have been a scourge to her enemies, you havebeen a rod to her friends; you have not indeed lovedthe common people.coriolanus:you should account me the more virtuous that i havenot been common in my love. i will, sir, flatter mysworn brother, the people, to earn a dearerestimation of them; 'tis a condition they accountgentle: and since the wisdom of their choice israther to have my hat than my heart, i will practisethe insinuating nod and be off to them mostcounterfeitly; that is, sir, i will counterfeit thebewitchment of some popular man and give itbountiful to the desirers. therefore, beseech you,i may be consul.fifth citizen:we hope to find you our friend; and therefore giveyou our voices heartily.fourth citizen:you have received many wounds for your country.coriolanus:i will not seal your knowledge with showing them. iwill make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.both citizens:the gods give you joy, sir, heartily!coriolanus:most sweet voices!better it is to die, better to starve,than crave the hire which first we do deserve.why in this woolvish toge should i stand here,to beg of hob and dick, that do appear,their needless vouches? custom calls me to't:what custom wills, in all things should we do't,the dust on antique time would lie unswept,and mountainous error be too highly heaptfor truth to o'er-peer. rather than fool it so,let the high office and the honour goto one that would do thus. i am half through;the one part suffer'd, the other will i do.here come more voices.your voices: for your voices i have fought;watch'd for your voices; for your voices bearof wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice sixi have seen and heard of; for your voices havedone many things, some less, some more your voices:indeed i would be consul.sixth citizen:he has done nobly, and cannot go without any honestman's voice.seventh citizen:therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,and make him good friend to the people!all citizens:amen, amen. god save thee, noble consul!coriolanus:worthy voices!menenius:you have stood your limitation; and the tribunesendue you with the people's voice: remainsthat, in the official marks invested, youanon do meet the senate.coriolanus:is this done?sicinius:the custom of request you have discharged:the people do admit you, and are summon'dto meet anon, upon your approbation.coriolanus:where? at the senate-house?sicinius:there, coriolanus.coriolanus:may i change these garments?sicinius:you may, sir.coriolanus:that i'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,repair to the senate-house.menenius:i'll keep you company. will you along?brutus:we stay here for the people.sicinius:fare you well.he has it now, and by his looks methink'tis warm at 's heart.brutus:with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.will you dismiss the people?sicinius:how now, my masters! have you chose this man?first citizen:he has our voices, sir.brutus:we pray the gods he may deserve your loves.second citizen:amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,he mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.third citizen:certainlyhe flouted us downright.first citizen:no,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.second citizen:not one amongst us, save yourself, but sayshe used us scornfully: he should have show'd ushis marks of merit, wounds received for's country.sicinius:why, so he did, i am sure.citizens:no, no; no man saw 'em.third citizen:he said he had wounds, which he could showin private;and with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,'i would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,but by your voices, will not so permit me;your voices therefore.' when we granted that,here was 'i thank you for your voices: thank you:your most sweet voices: now you have leftyour voices,i have no further with you.' was not this mockery?sicinius:why either were you ignorant to see't,or, seeing it, of such childish friendlinessto yield your voices?brutus:could you not have told himas you were lesson'd, when he had no power,but was a petty servant to the state,he was your enemy, ever spake againstyour liberties and the charters that you beari' the body of the weal; and now, arrivinga place of potency and sway o' the state,if he should still malignantly remainfast foe to the plebeii, your voices mightbe curses to yourselves? you should have saidthat as his worthy deeds did claim no lessthan what he stood for, so his gracious naturewould think upon you for your voices andtranslate his malice towards you into love,standing your friendly lord.sicinius:thus to have said,as you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spiritand tried his inclination; from him pluck'deither his gracious promise, which you might,as cause had call'd you up, have held him toor else it would have gall'd his surly nature,which easily endures not articletying him to aught; so putting him to rage,you should have ta'en the advantage of his cholerand pass'd him unelected.brutus:did you perceivehe did solicit you in free contemptwhen he did need your loves, and do you thinkthat his contempt shall not be bruising to you,when he hath power to crush? why, had your bodiesno heart among you? or had you tongues to cryagainst the rectorship of judgment?sicinius:have youere now denied the asker? and now againof him that did not ask, but mock, bestowyour sued-for tongues?third citizen:he's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.second citizen:and will deny him:i'll have five hundred voices of that sound.first citizen:i twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.brutus:get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,they have chose a consul that will from them taketheir liberties; make them of no more voicethan dogs that are as often beat for barkingas therefore kept to do so.sicinius:let them assemble,and on a safer judgment all revokeyour ignorant election; enforce his pride,and his old hate unto you; besides, forget notwith what contempt he wore the humble weed,how in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,thinking upon his services, took from youthe apprehension of his present portance,which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashionafter the inveterate hate he bears you.brutus:laya fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,no impediment between, but that you mustcast your election on him.sicinius:say, you chose himmore after our commandment than as guidedby your own true affections, and that your minds,preoccupied with what you rather must dothan what you should, made you against the grainto voice him consul: lay the fault on us.brutus:ay, spare us not. say we read lectures to you.how youngly he began to serve his country,how long continued, and what stock he springs of,the noble house o' the marcians, from whence camethat ancus marcius, numa's daughter's son,who, after great hostilius, here was king;of the same house publius and quintus were,that our beat water brought by conduits hither;and  twice being  was his great ancestor.sicinius:one thus descended,that hath beside well in his person wroughtto be set high in place, we did commendto your remembrances: but you have found,scaling his present bearing with his past,that he's your fixed enemy, and revokeyour sudden approbation.brutus:say, you ne'er had done't--harp on that still--but by our putting on;and presently, when you have drawn your number,repair to the capitol.all:we will so: almost allrepent in their election.brutus:let them go on;this mutiny were better put in hazard,than stay, past doubt, for greater:if, as his nature is, he fall in ragewith their refusal, both observe and answerthe vantage of his anger.sicinius:to the capitol, come:we will be there before the stream o' the people;and this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,which we have goaded onward.coriolanus:tullus aufidius then had made new head?lartius:he had, my lord; and that it was which causedour swifter composition.coriolanus:so then the volsces stand but as at first,ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.upon's again.cominius:they are worn, lord consul, so,that we shall hardly in our ages seetheir banners wave again.coriolanus:saw you aufidius?lartius:on safe-guard he came to me; and did curseagainst the volsces, for they had so vilelyyielded the town: he is retired to antium.coriolanus:spoke he of me?lartius:he did, my lord.coriolanus:how? what?lartius:how often he had met you, sword to sword;that of all things upon the earth he hatedyour person most, that he would pawn his fortunesto hopeless restitution, so he mightbe call'd your vanquisher.coriolanus:at antium lives he?lartius:at antium.coriolanus:i wish i had a cause to seek him there,to oppose his hatred fully. welcome home.behold, these are the tribunes of the people,the tongues o' the common mouth: i do despise them;for they do prank them in authority,against all noble sufferance.sicinius:pass no further.coriolanus:ha! what is that?brutus:it will be dangerous to go on: no further.coriolanus:what makes this change?menenius:the matter?cominius:hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?brutus:cominius, no.coriolanus:have i had children's voices?first senator:tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.brutus:the people are incensed against him.sicinius:stop,or all will fall in broil.coriolanus:are these your herd?must these have voices, that can yield them nowand straight disclaim their tongues? what areyour offices?you being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?have you not set them on?menenius:be calm, be calm.coriolanus:it is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,to curb the will of the nobility:suffer't, and live with such as cannot rulenor ever will be ruled.brutus:call't not a plot:the people cry you mock'd them, and of late,when corn was given them gratis, you repined;scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd themtime-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.coriolanus:why, this was known before.brutus:not to them all.coriolanus:have you inform'd them sithence?brutus:how! i inform them!coriolanus:you are like to do such business.brutus:not unlike,each way, to better yours.coriolanus:why then should i be consul? by yond clouds,let me deserve so ill as you, and make meyour fellow tribune.sicinius:you show too much of thatfor which the people stir: if you will passto where you are bound, you must inquire your way,which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,or never be so noble as a consul,nor yoke with him for tribune.menenius:let's be calm.cominius:the people are abused; set on. this palteringbecomes not rome, nor has coriolanusdeserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falselyi' the plain way of his merit.coriolanus:tell me of corn!this was my speech, and i will speak't again--menenius:not now, not now.first senator:not in this heat, sir, now.coriolanus:now, as i live, i will. my nobler friends,i crave their pardons:for the mutable, rank-scented many, let themregard me as i do not flatter, andtherein behold themselves: i say again,in soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senatethe cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,and scatter'd,by mingling them with us, the honour'd number,who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but thatwhich they have given to beggars.menenius:well, no more.first senator:no more words, we beseech you.coriolanus:how! no more!as for my country i have shed my blood,not fearing outward force, so shall my lungscoin words till their decay against those measles,which we disdain should tatter us, yet soughtthe very way to catch them.brutus:you speak o' the people,as if you were a god to punish, nota man of their infirmity.sicinius:'twere wellwe let the people know't.menenius:what, what? his choler?coriolanus:choler!were i as patient as the midnight sleep,by jove, 'twould be my mind!sicinius:it is a mindthat shall remain a poison where it is,not poison any further.coriolanus:shall remain!hear you this triton of the minnows? mark youhis absolute 'shall'?cominius:'twas from the canon.coriolanus:'shall'!o good but most unwise patricians! why,you grave but reckless senators, have you thusgiven hydra here to choose an officer,that with his peremptory 'shall,' being butthe horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spiritto say he'll turn your current in a ditch,and make your channel his? if he have powerthen vail your ignorance; if none, awakeyour dangerous lenity. if you are learn'd,be not as common fools; if you are not,let them have cushions by you. you are plebeians,if they be senators: and they are no less,when, both your voices blended, the great'st tastemost palates theirs. they choose their magistrate,and such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'his popular 'shall' against a graver benchthan ever frown in greece. by jove himself!it makes the consuls base: and my soul achesto know, when two authorities are up,neither supreme, how soon confusionmay enter 'twixt the gap of both and takethe one by the other.cominius:well, on to the market-place.coriolanus:whoever gave that counsel, to give forththe corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas usedsometime in greece,--menenius:well, well, no more of that.coriolanus:though there the people had more absolute power,i say, they nourish'd disobedience, fedthe ruin of the state.brutus:why, shall the people giveone that speaks thus their voice?coriolanus:i'll give my reasons,more worthier than their voices. they know the cornwas not our recompense, resting well assuredthat ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,even when the navel of the state was touch'd,they would not thread the gates. this kind of servicedid not deserve corn gratis. being i' the wartheir mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'dmost valour, spoke not for them: the accusationwhich they have often made against the senate,all cause unborn, could never be the motiveof our so frank donation. well, what then?how shall this bisson multitude digestthe senate's courtesy? let deeds expresswhat's like to be their words: 'we did request it;we are the greater poll, and in true fearthey gave us our demands.' thus we debasethe nature of our seats and make the rabblecall our cares fears; which will in timebreak ope the locks o' the senate and bring inthe crows to peck the eagles.menenius:come, enough.brutus:enough, with over-measure.coriolanus:no, take more:what may be sworn by, both divine and human,seal what i end withal! this double worship,where one part does disdain with cause, the otherinsult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,cannot conclude but by the yea and noof general ignorance,--it must omitreal necessities, and give way the whileto unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,it follows,nothing is done to purpose. therefore, beseech you,--you that will be less fearful than discreet,that love the fundamental part of statemore than you doubt the change on't, that prefera noble life before a long, and wishto jump a body with a dangerous physicthat's sure of death without it, at once pluck outthe multitudinous tongue; let them not lickthe sweet which is their poison: your dishonourmangles true judgment and bereaves the stateof that integrity which should become't,not having the power to do the good it would,for the in which doth control't.brutus:has said enough.sicinius:has spoken like a traitor, and shall answeras traitors do.coriolanus:thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!what should the people do with these bald tribunes?on whom depending, their obedience failsto the greater bench: in a rebellion,when what's not meet, but what must be, was law,then were they chosen: in a better hour,let what is meet be said it must be meet,and throw their power i' the dust.brutus:manifest treason!sicinius:this a consul? no.brutus:the aediles, ho!let him be apprehended.sicinius:go, call the people:in whose name myselfattach thee as a traitorous innovator,a foe to the public weal: obey, i charge thee,and follow to thine answer.coriolanus:hence, old goat!senators, &c:we'll surety him.cominius:aged sir, hands off.coriolanus:hence, rotten thing! or i shall shake thy bonesout of thy garments.sicinius:help, ye citizens!menenius:on both sides more respect.sicinius:here's he that would take from you all your power.brutus:seize him, aediles!citizens:down with him! down with him!senators, &c:weapons, weapons, weapons!'tribunes!'

i cannot do it to the gods;must i then do't to them?volumnia:you are too absolute;though therein you can never be too noble,but when extremities speak. i have heard you say,honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,i' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,in peace what each of them by the other lose,that they combine not there.coriolanus:tush, tush!menenius:a good demand.volumnia:if it be honour in your wars to seemthe same you are not, which, for your best ends,you adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,that it shall hold companionship in peacewith honour, as in war, since that to bothit stands in like request?coriolanus:why force you this?volumnia:because that now it lies you on to speakto the people; not by your own instruction,nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,but with such words that are but rooted inyour tongue, though but bastards and syllablesof no allowance to your bosom's truth.now, this no more dishonours you at allthan to take in a town with gentle words,which else would put you to your fortune andthe hazard of much blood.i would dissemble with my nature wheremy fortunes and my friends at stake requiredi should do so in honour: i am in this,your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;and you will rather show our general loutshow you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,for the inheritance of their loves and safeguardof what that want might ruin.menenius:noble lady!come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,not what is dangerous present, but the lossof what is past.volumnia:i prithee now, my son,go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;and thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--thy knee bussing the stones--for in such businessaction is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorantmore learned than the ears--waving thy head,which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,now humble as the ripest mulberrythat will not hold the handling: or say to them,thou art their soldier, and being bred in broilshast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,were fit for thee to use as they to claim,in asking their good loves, but thou wilt framethyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so faras thou hast power and person.menenius:this but done,even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;for they have pardons, being ask'd, as freeas words to little purpose.volumnia:prithee now,go, and be ruled: although i know thou hadst ratherfollow thine enemy in a fiery gulfthan flatter him in a bower. here is cominius.cominius:i have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fityou make strong party, or defend yourselfby calmness or by absence: all's in anger.menenius:only fair speech.cominius:i think 'twill serve, if hecan thereto frame his spirit.volumnia:he must, and willprithee now, say you will, and go about it.coriolanus:must i go show them my unbarbed sconce?must i with base tongue give my noble hearta lie that it must bear? well, i will do't:yet, were there but this single plot to lose,this mould of marcius, they to dust should grind itand throw't against the wind. to the market-place!you have put me now to such a part which neveri shall discharge to the life.cominius:come, come, we'll prompt you.volumnia:i prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast saidmy praises made thee first a soldier, so,to have my praise for this, perform a partthou hast not done before.coriolanus:well, i must do't:away, my disposition, and possess mesome harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,which quired with my drum, into a pipesmall as an eunuch, or the virgin voicethat babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knavestent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take upthe glasses of my sight! a beggar's tonguemake motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like histhat hath received an alms! i will not do't,lest i surcease to honour mine own truthand by my body's action teach my minda most inherent baseness.volumnia:at thy choice, then:to beg of thee, it is my more dishonourthan thou of them. come all to ruin; letthy mother rather feel thy pride than fearthy dangerous stoutness, for i mock at deathwith as big heart as thou. do as thou listthy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,but owe thy pride thyself.coriolanus:pray, be content:mother, i am going to the market-place;chide me no more. i'll mountebank their loves,cog their hearts from them, and come home belovedof all the trades in rome. look, i am going:commend me to my wife. i'll return consul;or never trust to what my tongue can doi' the way of flattery further.volumnia:do your will.cominius:away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourselfto answer mildly; for they are preparedwith accusations, as i hear, more strongthan are upon you yet.coriolanus:the word is 'mildly.' pray you, let us go:let them accuse me by invention, iwill answer in mine honour.menenius:ay, but mildly.coriolanus:well, mildly be it then. mildly!brutus:in this point charge him home, that he affectstyrannical power: if he evade us there,enforce him with his envy to the people,and that the spoil got on the antiateswas ne'er distributed.what, will he come?aedile:he's coming.brutus:how accompanied?aedile:with old menenius, and those senatorsthat always favour'd him.sicinius:have you a catalogueof all the voices that we have procuredset down by the poll?aedile:i have; 'tis ready.sicinius:have you collected them by tribes?aedile:i have.sicinius:assemble presently the people hither;and when they bear me say 'it shall be soi' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it eitherfor death, for fine, or banishment, then let themif i say fine, cry 'fine;' if death, cry 'death.'insisting on the old prerogativeand power i' the truth o' the cause.aedile:i shall inform them.brutus:and when such time they have begun to cry,let them not cease, but with a din confusedenforce the present executionof what we chance to sentence.aedile:very well.sicinius:make them be strong and ready for this hint,when we shall hap to give 't them.brutus:go about it.put him to choler straight: he hath been usedever to conquer, and to have his worthof contradiction: being once chafed, he cannotbe rein'd again to temperance; then he speakswhat's in his heart; and that is there which lookswith us to break his neck.sicinius:well, here he comes.menenius:calmly, i do beseech you.coriolanus:ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piecewill bear the knave by the volume. the honour'd godskeep rome in safety, and the chairs of justicesupplied with worthy men!

'tis an honester service than to meddle with thymistress. thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thytrencher, hence!aufidius:where is this fellow?second servingman:here, sir: i'ld have beaten him like a dog, but fordisturbing the lords within.aufidius:whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?coriolanus:if, tullus,not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost notthink me for the man i am, necessitycommands me name myself.aufidius:what is thy name?coriolanus:a name unmusical to the volscians' ears,and harsh in sound to thine.aufidius:say, what's thy name?thou hast a grim appearance, and thy facebears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?coriolanus:prepare thy brow to frown: know'stthou me yet?aufidius:i know thee not: thy name?coriolanus:my name is caius marcius, who hath doneto thee particularly and to all the volscesgreat hurt and mischief; thereto witness maymy surname, coriolanus: the painful service,the extreme dangers and the drops of bloodshed for my thankless country are requitedbut with that surname; a good memory,and witness of the malice and displeasurewhich thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;the cruelty and envy of the people,permitted by our dastard nobles, whohave all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;and suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to bewhoop'd out of rome. now this extremityhath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--mistake me not--to save my life, for ifi had fear'd death, of all the men i' the worldi would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,to be full quit of those my banishers,stand i before thee here. then if thou hasta heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revengethine own particular wrongs and stop those maimsof shame seen through thy country, speedthee straight,and make my misery serve thy turn: so use itthat my revengeful services may proveas benefits to thee, for i will fightagainst my canker'd country with the spleenof all the under fiends. but if so bethou darest not this and that to prove more fortunesthou'rt tired, then, in a word, i also amlonger to live most weary, and presentmy throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;which not to cut would show thee but a fool,since i have ever follow'd thee with hate,drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,and cannot live but to thy shame, unlessit be to do thee service.aufidius:o marcius, marcius!each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my hearta root of ancient envy. if jupitershould from yond cloud speak divine things,and say 'tis true,' i'ld not believe them morethan thee, all noble marcius. let me twinemine arms about that body, where againstmy grained ash an hundred times hath brokeand scarr'd the moon with splinters: here i clipthe anvil of my sword, and do contestas hotly and as nobly with thy loveas ever in ambitious strength i didcontend against thy valour. know thou first,i loved the maid i married; never mansigh'd truer breath; but that i see thee here,thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heartthan when i first my wedded mistress sawbestride my threshold. why, thou mars! i tell thee,we have a power on foot; and i had purposeonce more to hew thy target from thy brawn,or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me outtwelve several times, and i have nightly sincedreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;we have been down together in my sleep,unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,and waked half dead with nothing. worthy marcius,had we no quarrel else to rome, but thatthou art thence banish'd, we would muster allfrom twelve to seventy, and pouring warinto the bowels of ungrateful rome,like a bold flood o'er-bear. o, come, go in,and take our friendly senators by the hands;who now are here, taking their leaves of me,who am prepared against your territories,though not for rome itself.coriolanus:you bless me, gods!aufidius:therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt havethe leading of thine own revenges, takethe one half of my commission; and set down--as best thou art experienced, since thou know'stthy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;whether to knock against the gates of rome,or rudely visit them in parts remote,to fright them, ere destroy. but come in:let me commend thee first to those that shallsay yea to thy desires. a thousand welcomes!and more a friend than e'er an enemy;yet, marcius, that was much. your hand: most welcome!first servingman:here's a strange alteration!second servingman:by my hand, i had thought to have strucken him witha cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made afalse report of him.first servingman:what an arm he has! he turned me about with hisfinger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.second servingman:nay, i knew by his face that there was something inhim: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--icannot tell how to term it.first servingman:he had so; looking as it were--would i were hanged,but i thought there was more in him than i could think.second servingman:so did i, i'll be sworn: he is simply the rarestman i' the world.first servingman:i think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.second servingman:who, my master?first servingman:nay, it's no matter for that.second servingman:worth six on him.first servingman:nay, not so neither: but i take him to be thegreater soldier.second servingman:faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.first servingman:ay, and for an assault too.third servingman:o slaves, i can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!first servingman:what, what, what? let's partake.third servingman:i would not be a roman, of all nations; i had aslieve be a condemned man.first servingman:wherefore? wherefore?third servingman:why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,caius marcius.first servingman:why do you say 'thwack our general '?third servingman:i do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was alwaysgood enough for him.second servingman:come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever toohard for him; i have heard him say so himself.first servingman:he was too hard for him directly, to say the trothon't: before corioli he scotched him and notchedhim like a carbon ado.second servingman:an he had been cannibally given, he might havebroiled and eaten him too.first servingman:but, more of thy news?third servingman:why, he is so made on here within, as if he were sonand heir to mars; set at upper end o' the table; noquestion asked him by any of the senators, but theystand bald before him: our general himself makes amistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand andturns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. butthe bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'the middle and but one half of what he wasyesterday; for the other has half, by the entreatyand grant of the whole table. he'll go, he says,and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears: hewill mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.second servingman:and he's as like to do't as any man i can imagine.third servingman:do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has asmany friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as itwere, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, aswe term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.first servingman:directitude! what's that?third servingman:but when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,and the man in blood, they will out of theirburrows, like conies after rain, and revel all withhim.first servingman:but when goes this forward?third servingman:to-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have thedrum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, aparcel of their feast, and to be executed ere theywipe their lips.second servingman:why, then we shall have a stirring world again.this peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increasetailors, and breed ballad-makers.first servingman:let me have war, say i; it exceeds peace as far asday does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, andfull of vent. peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of morebastard children than war's a destroyer of men.second servingman:'tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said tobe a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is agreat maker of cuckolds.first servingman:ay, and it makes men hate one another.third servingman:reason; because they then less need one another.the wars for my money. i hope to see romans as cheapas volscians. they are rising, they are rising.all:in, in, in, in!sicinius:we hear not of him, neither need we fear him;his remedies are tame i' the present peaceand quietness of the people, which beforewere in wild hurry. here do we make his friendsblush that the world goes well, who rather had,though they themselves did suffer by't, beholddissentious numbers pestering streets than seeour tradesmen with in their shops and goingabout their functions friendly.brutus:we stood to't in good time.is this menenius?sicinius:'tis he,'tis he: o, he is grown most kind of late.both tribunes:hail sir!menenius:hail to you both!sicinius:your coriolanusis not much miss'd, but with his friends:the commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,were he more angry at it.menenius:all's well; and might have been much better, ifhe could have temporized.sicinius:where is he, hear you?menenius:nay, i hear nothing: his mother and his wifehear nothing from him.citizens:the gods preserve you both!sicinius:god-den, our neighbours.brutus:god-den to you all, god-den to you all.first citizen:ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,are bound to pray for you both.sicinius:live, and thrive!brutus:farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd coriolanushad loved you as we did.citizens:now the gods keep you!both tribunes:farewell, farewell.sicinius:this is a happier and more comely timethan when these fellows ran about the streets,crying confusion.brutus:caius marcius wasa worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,o'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,self-loving,--sicinius:and affecting one sole throne,without assistance.menenius:i think not so.sicinius:we should by this, to all our lamentation,if he had gone forth consul, found it so.brutus:the gods have well prevented it, and romesits safe and still without him.aedile:worthy tribunes,there is a slave, whom we have put in prison,reports, the volsces with two several powersare enter'd in the roman territories,and with the deepest malice of the wardestroy what lies before 'em.menenius:'tis aufidius,who, hearing of our marcius' banishment,thrusts forth his horns again into the world;which were inshell'd when marcius stood for rome,and durst not once peep out.sicinius:come, what talk youof marcius?brutus:go see this rumourer whipp'd. it cannot bethe volsces dare break with us.menenius:cannot be!we have record that very well it can,and three examples of the like have beenwithin my age. but reason with the fellow,before you punish him, where he heard this,lest you shall chance to whip your informationand beat the messenger who bids bewareof what is to be dreaded.sicinius:tell not me:i know this cannot be.brutus:not possible.messenger:the nobles in great earnestness are goingall to the senate-house: some news is comethat turns their countenances.sicinius:'tis this slave;--go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;nothing but his report.messenger:yes, worthy sir,the slave's report is seconded; and more,more fearful, is deliver'd.sicinius:what more fearful?messenger:it is spoke freely out of many mouths--how probable i do not know--that marcius,join'd with aufidius, leads a power 'gainst rome,and vows revenge as spacious as betweenthe young'st and oldest thing.sicinius:this is most likely!brutus:raised only, that the weaker sort may wishgood marcius home again.sicinius:the very trick on't.menenius:this is unlikely:he and aufidius can no more atonethan violentest contrariety.second messenger:you are sent for to the senate:a fearful army, led by caius marciusassociated with aufidius, ragesupon our territories; and have alreadyo'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and tookwhat lay before them.cominius:o, you have made good work!menenius:what news? what news?cominius:you have holp to ravish your own daughters andto melt the city leads upon your pates,to see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--menenius:what's the news? what's the news?cominius:your temples burned in their cement, andyour franchises, whereon you stood, confinedinto an auger's bore.menenius:pray now, your news?you have made fair work, i fear me.--pray, your news?--if marcius should be join'd with volscians,--cominius:if!he is their god: he leads them like a thingmade by some other deity than nature,that shapes man better; and they follow him,against us brats, with no less confidencethan boys pursuing summer butterflies,or butchers killing flies.menenius:you have made good work,you and your apron-men; you that stood so up muchon the voice of occupation andthe breath of garlic-eaters!cominius:he will shakeyour rome about your ears.menenius:as herculesdid shake down mellow fruit.you have made fair work!brutus:but is this true, sir?cominius:ay; and you'll look palebefore you find it other. all the regionsdo smilingly revolt; and who resistare mock'd for valiant ignorance,and perish constant fools. who is't can blame him?your enemies and his find something in him.menenius:we are all undone, unlessthe noble man have mercy.cominius:who shall ask it?the tribunes cannot do't for shame; the peopledeserve such pity of him as the wolfdoes of the shepherds: for his best friends, if theyshould say 'be good to rome,' they charged him evenas those should do that had deserved his hate,and therein show'd like enemies.menenius:'tis true:if he were putting to my house the brandthat should consume it, i have not the faceto say 'beseech you, cease.' you have made fair hands,you and your crafts! you have crafted fair!cominius:you have broughta trembling upon rome, such as was neverso incapable of help.both tribunes:say not we brought it.menenius:how! was it we? we loved him but, like beastsand cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,who did hoot him out o' the city.cominius:but i fearthey'll roar him in again. tullus aufidius,the second name of men, obeys his pointsas if he were his officer: desperationis all the policy, strength and defence,that rome can make against them.menenius:here come the clusters.and is aufidius with him? you are theythat made the air unwholesome, when you castyour stinking greasy caps in hooting atcoriolanus' exile. now he's coming;and not a hair upon a soldier's headwhich will not prove a whip: as many coxcombsas you threw caps up will he tumble down,and pay you for your voices. 'tis no matter;if he could burn us all into one coal,we have deserved it.citizens:faith, we hear fearful news.first citizen:for mine own part,when i said, banish him, i said 'twas pity.second citizen:and so did i.third citizen:and so did i; and, to say the truth, so did verymany of us: that we did, we did for the best; andthough we willingly consented to his banishment, yetit was against our will.cominius:ye re goodly things, you voices!menenius:you have madegood work, you and your cry! shall's to the capitol?cominius:o, ay, what else?sicinius:go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:these are a side that would be glad to havethis true which they so seem to fear. go home,and show no sign of fear.first citizen:the gods be good to us! come, masters, let's home.i ever said we were i' the wrong when we banishedhim.second citizen:so did we all. but, come, let's home.brutus:i do not like this news.sicinius:nor i.brutus:let's to the capitol. would half my wealthwould buy this for a lie!sicinius:pray, let us go.aufidius:do they still fly to the roman?lieutenant:i do not know what witchcraft's in him, butyour soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,their talk at table, and their thanks at end;and you are darken'd in this action, sir,even by your own.aufidius:i cannot help it now,unless, by using means, i lame the footof our design. he bears himself more proudlier,even to my person, than i thought he wouldwhen first i did embrace him: yet his naturein that's no changeling; and i must excusewhat cannot be amended.lieutenant:yet i wish, sir,--i mean for your particular,--you had notjoin'd in commission with him; but eitherhad borne the action of yourself, or elseto him had left it solely.aufidius:i understand thee well; and be thou sure,when he shall come to his account, he knows notwhat i can urge against him. although it seems,and so he thinks, and is no less apparentto the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.and shows good husbandry for the volscian state,fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soonas draw his sword; yet he hath left undonethat which shall break his neck or hazard mine,whene'er we come to our account.lieutenant:sir, i beseech you, think you he'll carry rome?aufidius:all places yield to him ere he sits down;and the nobility of rome are his:the senators and patricians love him too:the tribunes are no soldiers; and their peoplewill be as rash in the repeal, as hastyto expel him thence. i think he'll be to romeas is the osprey to the fish, who takes itby sovereignty of nature. first he wasa noble servant to them; but he could notcarry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,which out of daily fortune ever taintsthe happy man; whether defect of judgment,to fail in the disposing of those chanceswhich he was lord of; or whether nature,not to be other than one thing, not movingfrom the casque to the cushion, but commanding peaceeven with the same austerity and garbas he controll'd the war; but one of these--as he hath spices of them all, not all,for i dare so far free him--made him fear'd,so hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,to choke it in the utterance. so our virtueslie in the interpretation of the time:and power, unto itself most commendable,hath not a tomb so evident as a chairto extol what it hath done.one fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.come, let's away. when, caius, rome is thine,thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.menenius:no, i'll not go: you hear what he hath saidwhich was sometime his general; who loved himin a most dear particular. he call'd me father:but what o' that? go, you that banish'd him;a mile before his tent fall down, and kneethe way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'dto hear cominius speak, i'll keep at home.cominius:he would not seem to know me.menenius:do you hear?cominius:yet one time he did call me by my name:i urged our old acquaintance, and the dropsthat we have bled together. coriolanushe would not answer to: forbad all names;he was a kind of nothing, titleless,till he had forged himself a name o' the fireof burning rome.menenius:why, so: you have made good work!a pair of tribunes that have rack'd for rome,to make coals cheap,--a noble memory!cominius:i minded him how royal 'twas to pardonwhen it was less expected: he replied,it was a bare petition of a stateto one whom they had punish'd.menenius:very well:could he say less?cominius:i offer'd to awaken his regardfor's private friends: his answer to me was,he could not stay to pick them in a pileof noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,for one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,and still to nose the offence.menenius:for one poor grain or two!i am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,and this brave fellow too, we are the grains:you are the musty chaff; and you are smeltabove the moon: we must be burnt for you.sicinius:nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aidin this so never-needed help, yet do notupbraid's with our distress. but, sure, if youwould be your country's pleader, your good tongue,more than the instant army we can make,might stop our countryman.menenius:no, i'll not meddle.sicinius:pray you, go to him.menenius:what should i do?brutus:only make trial what your love can dofor rome, towards marcius.menenius:well, and say that marciusreturn me, as cominius is return'd,unheard; what then?but as a discontented friend, grief-shotwith his unkindness? say't be so?sicinius:yet your good willmust have that thanks from rome, after the measureas you intended well.menenius:i'll undertake 't:i think he'll hear me. yet, to bite his lipand hum at good cominius, much unhearts me.he was not taken well; he had not dined:the veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and thenwe pout upon the morning, are unaptto give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'dthese and these conveyances of our bloodwith wine and feeding, we have suppler soulsthan in our priest-like fasts: therefore i'll watch himtill he be dieted to my request,and then i'll set upon him.brutus:you know the very road into his kindness,and cannot lose your way.menenius:good faith, i'll prove him,speed how it will. i shall ere long have knowledgeof my success.cominius:he'll never hear him.sicinius:not?cominius:i tell you, he does sit in gold, his eyered as 'twould burn rome; and his injurythe gaoler to his pity. i kneel'd before him;'twas very faintly he said 'rise;' dismiss'd methus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,he sent in writing after me; what he would not,bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:so that all hope is vain.unless his noble mother, and his wife;who, as i hear, mean to solicit himfor mercy to his country. therefore, let's hence,and with our fair entreaties haste them on.first senator:stay: whence are you?second senator:stand, and go back.menenius:you guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,i am an officer of state, and cometo speak with coriolanus.first senator:from whence?menenius:from rome.first senator:you may not pass, you must return: our generalwill no more hear from thence.second senator:you'll see your rome embraced with fire beforeyou'll speak with coriolanus.menenius:good my friends,if you have heard your general talk of rome,and of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,my name hath touch'd your ears it is menenius.first senator:be it so; go back: the virtue of your nameis not here passable.menenius:i tell thee, fellow,the general is my lover: i have beenthe book of his good acts, whence men have readhis name unparallel'd, haply amplified;for i have ever verified my friends,of whom he's chief, with all the size that veritywould without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,i have tumbled past the throw; and in his praisehave almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,i must have leave to pass.first senator:faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in hisbehalf as you have uttered words in your own, youshould not pass here; no, though it were as virtuousto lie as to live chastely. therefore, go back.menenius:prithee, fellow, remember my name is menenius,always factionary on the party of your general.second senator:howsoever you have been his liar, as you say youhave, i am one that, telling true under him, mustsay, you cannot pass. therefore, go back.menenius:has he dined, canst thou tell? for i would notspeak with him till after dinner.first senator:you are a roman, are you?menenius:i am, as thy general is.first senator:then you should hate rome, as he does. can you,when you have pushed out your gates the verydefender of them, and, in a violent popularignorance, given your enemy your shield, think tofront his revenges with the easy groans of oldwomen, the virginal palms of your daughters, or withthe palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant asyou seem to be? can you think to blow out theintended fire your city is ready to flame in, withsuch weak breath as this? no, you are deceived;therefore, back to rome, and prepare for yourexecution: you are condemned, our general has swornyou out of reprieve and pardon.menenius:sirrah, if thy captain knew i were here, he woulduse me with estimation.second senator:come, my captain knows you not.menenius:i mean, thy general.first senator:my general cares not for you. back, i say, go; lesti let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that'sthe utmost of your having: back.menenius:nay, but, fellow, fellow,--coriolanus:what's the matter?menenius:now, you companion, i'll say an errand for you:you shall know now that i am in estimation; you shallperceive that a jack guardant cannot office me frommy son coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainmentwith him, if thou standest not i' the state ofhanging, or of some death more long inspectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold nowpresently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thyparticular prosperity, and love thee no worse thanthy old father menenius does! o my son, my son!thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here'swater to quench it. i was hardly moved to come tothee; but being assured none but myself could movethee, i have been blown out of your gates withsighs; and conjure thee to pardon rome, and thypetitionary countrymen. the good gods assuage thywrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlethere,--this, who, like a block, hath denied myaccess to thee.coriolanus:away!menenius:how! away!coriolanus:wife, mother, child, i know not. my affairsare servanted to others: though i owemy revenge properly, my remission liesin volscian breasts. that we have been familiar,ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, ratherthan pity note how much. therefore, be gone.mine ears against your suits are stronger thanyour gates against my force. yet, for i loved thee,take this along; i writ it for thy sakeand would have rent it. another word, menenius,i will not hear thee speak. this man, aufidius,was my beloved in rome: yet thou behold'st!aufidius:you keep a constant temper.first senator:now, sir, is your name menenius?second senator:'tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know theway home again.first senator:do you hear how we are shent for keeping yourgreatness back?second senator:what cause, do you think, i have to swoon?menenius:i neither care for the world nor your general: forsuch things as you, i can scarce think there's any,ye're so slight. he that hath a will to die byhimself fears it not from another: let your generaldo his worst. for you, be that you are, long; andyour misery increase with your age! i say to you,as i was said to, away!first senator:a noble fellow, i warrant him.second senator:the worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, theoak not to be wind-shaken.coriolanus:we will before the walls of rome tomorrowset down our host. my partner in this action,you must report to the volscian lords, how plainlyi have borne this business.aufidius:only their endsyou have respected; stopp'd your ears againstthe general suit of rome; never admitteda private whisper, no, not with such friendsthat thought them sure of you.coriolanus:this last old man,whom with a crack'd heart i have sent to rome,loved me above the measure of a father;nay, godded me, indeed. their latest refugewas to send him; for whose old love i have,though i show'd sourly to him, once more offer'dthe first conditions, which they did refuseand cannot now accept; to grace him onlythat thought he could do more, a very littlei have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,nor from the state nor private friends, hereafterwill i lend ear to. ha! what shout is this?shall i be tempted to infringe my vowin the same time 'tis made? i will not.my wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mouldwherein this trunk was framed, and in her handthe grandchild to her blood. but, out, affection!all bond and privilege of nature, break!let it be virtuous to be obstinate.what is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,which can make gods forsworn? i melt, and am notof stronger earth than others. my mother bows;as if olympus to a molehill shouldin supplication nod: and my young boyhath an aspect of intercession, whichgreat nature cries 'deny not.' let the volscesplough rome and harrow italy: i'll neverbe such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,as if a man were author of himselfand knew no other kin.virgilia:my lord and husband!coriolanus:these eyes are not the same i wore in rome.virgilia:the sorrow that delivers us thus changedmakes you think so.coriolanus:like a dull actor now,i have forgot my part, and i am out,even to a full disgrace. best of my flesh,forgive my tyranny; but do not sayfor that 'forgive our romans.' o, a kisslong as my exile, sweet as my revenge!now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kissi carried from thee, dear; and my true liphath virgin'd it e'er since. you gods! i prate,and the most noble mother of the worldleave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;of thy deep duty more impression showthan that of common sons.volumnia:o, stand up blest!whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,i kneel before thee;

then let the mutinous windsstrike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;murdering impossibility, to makewhat cannot be, slight work.volumnia:thou art my warrior;i holp to frame thee. do you know this lady?coriolanus:the noble sister of publicola,the moon of rome, chaste as the iciclethat's curdied by the frost from purest snowand hangs on dian's temple: dear valeria!volumnia:this is a poor epitome of yours,which by the interpretation of full timemay show like all yourself.coriolanus:the god of soldiers,with the consent of supreme jove, informthy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst proveto shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the warslike a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,and saving those that eye thee!volumnia:your knee, sirrah.coriolanus:that's my brave boy!volumnia:even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,are suitors to you.coriolanus:i beseech you, peace:or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:the thing i have forsworn to grant may neverbe held by you denials. do not bid medismiss my soldiers, or capitulateagain with rome's mechanics: tell me notwherein i seem unnatural: desire notto ally my rages and revenges withyour colder reasons.volumnia:o, no more, no more!you have said you will not grant us any thing;for we have nothing else to ask, but thatwhich you deny already: yet we will ask;that, if you fail in our request, the blamemay hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.coriolanus:aufidius, and you volsces, mark; for we'llhear nought from rome in private. your request?volumnia:should we be silent and not speak, our raimentand state of bodies would bewray what lifewe have led since thy exile. think with thyselfhow more unfortunate than all living womenare we come hither: since that thy sight,which shouldmake our eyes flow with joy, hearts dancewith comforts,constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;making the mother, wife and child to seethe son, the husband and the father tearinghis country's bowels out. and to poor wethine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st usour prayers to the gods, which is a comfortthat all but we enjoy; for how can we,alas, how can we for our country pray.whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,whereto we are bound? alack, or we must losethe country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,our comfort in the country. we must findan evident calamity, though we hadour wish, which side should win: for either thoumust, as a foreign recreant, be ledwith manacles thorough our streets, or elsetriumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,and bear the palm for having bravely shedthy wife and children's blood. for myself, son,i purpose not to wait on fortune tillthese wars determine: if i cannot persuade theerather to show a noble grace to both partsthan seek the end of one, thou shalt no soonermarch to assault thy country than to tread--trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,that brought thee to this world.virgilia:ay, and mine,that brought you forth this boy, to keep your nameliving to time.young marcius:a' shall not tread on me;i'll run away till i am bigger, but then i'll fight.coriolanus:not of a woman's tenderness to be,requires nor child nor woman's face to see.i have sat too long.volumnia:nay, go not from us thus.if it were so that our request did tendto save the romans, thereby to destroythe volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,as poisonous of your honour: no; our suitis that you reconcile them: while the volscesmay say 'this mercy we have show'd;' the romans,'this we received;' and each in either sidegive the all-hail to thee and cry 'be blestfor making up this peace!' thou know'st, great son,the end of war's uncertain, but this certain,that, if thou conquer rome, the benefitwhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;whose chronicle thus writ: 'the man was noble,but with his last attempt he wiped it out;destroy'd his country, and his name remainsto the ensuing age abhorr'd.' speak to me, son:thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,to imitate the graces of the gods;to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,and yet to charge thy sulphur with a boltthat should but rive an oak. why dost not speak?think'st thou it honourable for a noble manstill to remember wrongs? daughter, speak you:he cares not for your weeping. speak thou, boy:perhaps thy childishness will move him morethan can our reasons. there's no man in the worldmore bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me pratelike one i' the stocks. thou hast never in thy lifeshow'd thy dear mother any courtesy,when she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,loaden with honour. say my request's unjust,and spurn me back: but if it be not so,thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,that thou restrain'st from me the duty whichto a mother's part belongs. he turns away:down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.to his surname coriolanus 'longs more pridethan pity to our prayers. down: an end;this is the last: so we will home to rome,and die among our neighbours. nay, behold 's:this boy, that cannot tell what he would havebut kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,does reason our petition with more strengththan thou hast to deny 't. come, let us go:this fellow had a volscian to his mother;his wife is in corioli and his childlike him by chance. yet give us our dispatch:i am hush'd until our city be a-fire,and then i'll speak a little.coriolanus:o mother, mother!what have you done? behold, the heavens do ope,the gods look down, and this unnatural scenethey laugh at. o my mother, mother! o!you have won a happy victory to rome;but, for your son,--believe it, o, believe it,most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,if not most mortal to him. but, let it come.aufidius, though i cannot make true wars,i'll frame convenient peace. now, good aufidius,were you in my stead, would you have hearda mother less? or granted less, aufidius?aufidius:i was moved withal.coriolanus:i dare be sworn you were:and, sir, it is no little thing to makemine eyes to sweat compassion. but, good sir,what peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,i'll not to rome, i'll back with you; and pray you,stand to me in this cause. o mother! wife!aufidius:coriolanus:ay, by and by;but we will drink together; and you shall beara better witness back than words, which we,on like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.come, enter with us. ladies, you deserveto have a temple built you: all the swordsin italy, and her confederate arms,could not have made this peace.menenius:see you yond coign o' the capitol, yondcorner-stone?sicinius:why, what of that?menenius:if it be possible for you to displace it with yourlittle finger, there is some hope the ladies ofrome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.but i say there is no hope in't: our throats aresentenced and stay upon execution.sicinius:is't possible that so short a time can alter thecondition of a man!menenius:there is differency between a grub and a butterfly;yet your butterfly was a grub. this marcius is grownfrom man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than acreeping thing.sicinius:he loved his mother dearly.menenius:so did he me: and he no more remembers his mothernow than an eight-year-old horse. the tartnessof his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, hemoves like an engine, and the ground shrinks beforehis treading: he is able to pierce a corslet withhis eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is abattery. he sits in his state, as a thing made foralexander. what he bids be done is finished withhis bidding. he wants nothing of a god but eternityand a heaven to throne in.sicinius:yes, mercy, if you report him truly.menenius:i paint him in the character. mark what mercy hismother shall bring from him: there is no more mercyin him than there is milk in a male tiger; thatshall our poor city find: and all this is long ofyou.sicinius:the gods be good unto us!menenius:no, in such a case the gods will not be good untous. when we banished him, we respected not them;and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.messenger:sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:the plebeians have got your fellow-tribuneand hale him up and down, all swearing, ifthe roman ladies bring not comfort home,they'll give him death by inches.sicinius:what's the news?second messenger:good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,the volscians are dislodged, and marcius gone:a merrier day did never yet greet rome,no, not the expulsion of the tarquins.sicinius:friend,art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?second messenger:as certain as i know the sun is fire:where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,as the recomforted through the gates. why, hark you!the trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,tabours and cymbals and the shouting romans,make the sun dance. hark you!menenius:this is good news:i will go meet the ladies. this volumniais worth of consuls, senators, patricians,a city full; of tribunes, such as you,a sea and land full. you have pray'd well to-day:this morning for ten thousand of your throatsi'd not have given a doit. hark, how they joy!sicinius:first, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,accept my thankfulness.second messenger:sir, we have allgreat cause to give great thanks.sicinius:they are near the city?second messenger:almost at point to enter.sicinius:we will meet them,and help the joy.first senator:behold our patroness, the life of rome!call all your tribes together, praise the gods,and make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:unshout the noise that banish'd marcius,repeal him with the welcome of his mother;cry 'welcome, ladies, welcome!'all:welcome, ladies, welcome!aufidius:go tell the lords o' the city i am here:deliver them this paper: having read it,bid them repair to the market place; where i,even in theirs and in the commons' ears,will vouch the truth of it. him i accusethe city ports by this hath enter'd andintends to appear before the people, hopingto purge herself with words: dispatch.most welcome!first conspirator:how is it with our general?aufidius:even soas with a man by his own alms empoison'd,and with his charity slain.second conspirator:most noble sir,if you do hold the same intent whereinyou wish'd us parties, we'll deliver youof your great danger.aufidius:sir, i cannot tell:we must proceed as we do find the people.third conspirator:the people will remain uncertain whilst'twixt you there's difference; but the fall of eithermakes the survivor heir of all.aufidius:i know it;and my pretext to strike at him admitsa good construction. i raised him, and i pawn'dmine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,he water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,seducing so my friends; and, to this end,he bow'd his nature, never known beforebut to be rough, unswayable and free.third conspirator:sir, his stoutnesswhen he did stand for consul, which he lostby lack of stooping,--aufidius:that i would have spoke of:being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;presented to my knife his throat: i took him;made him joint-servant with me; gave him wayin all his own desires; nay, let him chooseout of my files, his projects to accomplish,my best and freshest men; served his designmentsin mine own person; holp to reap the famewhich he did end all his; and took some prideto do myself this wrong: till, at the last,i seem'd his follower, not partner, andhe waged me with his countenance, as ifi had been mercenary.first conspirator:so he did, my lord:the army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,when he had carried rome and that we look'dfor no less spoil than glory,--aufidius:there was it:for which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.at a few drops of women's rheum, which areas cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labourof our great action: therefore shall he die,and i'll renew me in his fall. but, hark!first conspirator:your native town you enter'd like a post,and had no welcomes home: but he returns,splitting the air with noise.second conspirator:and patient fools,whose children he hath slain, their base throats tearwith giving him glory.third conspirator:therefore, at your vantage,ere he express himself, or move the peoplewith what he would say, let him feel your sword,which we will second. when he lies along,after your way his tale pronounced shall buryhis reasons with his body.aufidius:say no more:here come the lords.all the lords:you are most welcome home.aufidius:i have not deserved it.but, worthy lords, have you with heed perusedwhat i have written to you?lords:we have.first lord:and grieve to hear't.what faults he made before the last, i thinkmight have found easy fines: but there to endwhere he was to begin and give awaythe benefit of our levies, answering uswith our own charge, making a treaty wherethere was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.aufidius:he approaches: you shall hear him.coriolanus:hail, lords! i am return'd your soldier,no more infected with my country's lovethan when i parted hence, but still subsistingunder your great command. you are to knowthat prosperously i have attempted andwith bloody passage led your wars even tothe gates of rome. our spoils we have brought homedo more than counterpoise a full third partthe charges of the action. we have made peacewith no less honour to the antiatesthan shame to the romans: and we here deliver,subscribed by the consuls and patricians,together with the seal o' the senate, whatwe have compounded on.aufidius:read it not, noble lords;but tell the traitor, in the high'st degreehe hath abused your powers.coriolanus:traitor! how now!aufidius:ay, traitor, marcius!coriolanus:marcius!aufidius:ay, marcius, caius marcius: dost thou thinki'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n namecoriolanus in corioli?you lords and heads o' the state, perfidiouslyhe has betray'd your business, and given up,for certain drops of salt, your city rome,i say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;breaking his oath and resolution likea twist of rotten silk, never admittingcounsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tearshe whined and roar'd away your victory,that pages blush'd at him and men of heartlook'd wondering each at other.coriolanus:hear'st thou, mars?aufidius:name not the god, thou boy of tears!coriolanus:ha!aufidius:no more.coriolanus:measureless liar, thou hast made my hearttoo great for what contains it. boy! o slave!pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that everi was forced to scold. your judgments, my grave lords,must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; thatmust bear my beating to his grave--shall jointo thrust the lie unto him.first lord:peace, both, and hear me speak.coriolanus:cut me to pieces, volsces; men and lads,stain all your edges on me. boy! false hound!if you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,that, like an eagle in a dove-cote, iflutter'd your volscians in corioli:alone i did it. boy!aufidius:why, noble lords,will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,'fore your own eyes and ears?all conspirators:let him die for't.all the people:'tear him to pieces.' 'do it presently.' 'he kill'dmy son.' 'my daughter.' 'he killed my cousinmarcus.' 'he killed my father.'second lord:peace, ho! no outrage: peace!the man is noble and his fame folds-inthis orb o' the earth. his last offences to usshall have judicious hearing. stand, aufidius,and trouble not the peace.coriolanus:o that i had him,with six aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,to use my lawful sword!aufidius:insolent villain!all conspirators:kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!lords:hold, hold, hold, hold!aufidius:my noble masters, hear me speak.first lord:o tullus,--second lord:thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.third lord:tread not upon him. masters all, be quiet;put up your swords.aufidius:my lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,provoked by him, you cannot--the great dangerwhich this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoicethat he is thus cut off. please it your honoursto call me to your senate, i'll delivermyself your loyal servant, or endureyour heaviest censure.first lord:bear from hence his body;and mourn you for him: let him be regardedas the most noble corse that ever heralddid follow to his urn.second lord:his own impatiencetakes from aufidius a great part of blame.let's make the best of it.aufidius:my rage is gone;and i am struck with sorrow. take him up.help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; i'll be one.beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:trail your steel pikes. though in this city hehath widow'd and unchilded many a one,which to this hour bewail the injury,yet he shall have a noble memory. assist.gloucester:now is the winter of our discontentmade glorious summer by this sun of york;and all the clouds that lour'd upon our housein the deep bosom of the ocean buried.now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;our bruised arms hung up for monuments;our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,our dreadful marches to delightful measures.grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;and now, instead of mounting barded steedsto fright the souls of fearful adversaries,he capers nimbly in a lady's chamberto the lascivious pleasing of a lute.but i, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;i, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majestyto strut before a wanton ambling nymph;i, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,cheated of feature by dissembling nature,deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my timeinto this breathing world, scarce half made up,and that so lamely and unfashionablethat dogs bark at me as i halt by them;why, i, in this weak piping time of peace,have no delight to pass away the time,unless to spy my shadow in the sunand descant on mine own deformity:and therefore, since i cannot prove a lover,to entertain these fair well-spoken days,i am determined to prove a villainand hate the idle pleasures of these days.plots have i laid, inductions dangerous,by drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,to set my brother clarence and the kingin deadly hate the one against the other:and if king edward be as true and justas i am subtle, false and treacherous,this day should clarence closely be mew'd up,about a prophecy, which says that 'g'of edward's heirs the murderer shall be.dive, thoughts, down to my soul: hereclarence comes.brother, good day; what means this armed guardthat waits upon your grace?clarence:his majestytendering my person's safety, hath appointedthis conduct to convey me to the tower.gloucester:upon what cause?clarence:because my name is george.gloucester:alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;he should, for that, commit your godfathers:o, belike his majesty hath some intentthat you shall be new-christen'd in the tower.but what's the matter, clarence?  may i know?clarence:yea, richard, when i know; for i protestas yet i do not: but, as i can learn,he hearkens after prophecies and dreams;and from the cross-row plucks the letter g.and says a wizard told him that by ghis issue disinherited should be;and, for my name of george begins with g,it follows in his thought that i am he.these, as i learn, and such like toys as thesehave moved his highness to commit me now.gloucester:why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:'tis not the king that sends you to the tower:my lady grey his wife, clarence, 'tis shethat tempers him to this extremity.was it not she and that good man of worship,anthony woodville, her brother there,that made him send lord hastings to the tower,from whence this present day he is deliver'd?we are not safe, clarence; we are not safe.clarence:by heaven, i think there's no man is securebut the queen's kindred and night-walking heraldsthat trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore.heard ye not what an humble suppliantlord hastings was to her for his delivery?gloucester:humbly complaining to her deitygot my lord chamberlain his liberty.i'll tell you what; i think it is our way,if we will keep in favour with the king,to be her men and wear her livery:the jealous o'erworn widow and herself,since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.are mighty gossips in this monarchy.brakenbury:i beseech your graces both to pardon me;his majesty hath straitly given in chargethat no man shall have private conference,of what degree soever, with his brother.gloucester:even so; an't please your worship, brakenbury,you may partake of any thing we say:we speak no treason, man: we say the kingis wise and virtuous, and his noble queenwell struck in years, fair, and not jealous;we say that shore's wife hath a pretty foot,a cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;and that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:how say you sir? can you deny all this?brakenbury:with this, my lord, myself have nought to do.gloucester:naught to do with mistress shore! i tell thee, fellow,he that doth naught with her, excepting one,were best he do it secretly, alone.brakenbury:what one, my lord?gloucester:her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?brakenbury:i beseech your grace to pardon me, and withalforbear your conference with the noble duke.clarence:we know thy charge, brakenbury, and will obey.gloucester:we are the queen's abjects, and must obey.brother, farewell: i will unto the king;and whatsoever you will employ me in,were it to call king edward's widow sister,i will perform it to enfranchise you.meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhoodtouches me deeper than you can imagine.clarence:i know it pleaseth neither of us well.gloucester:well, your imprisonment shall not be long;meantime, have patience.clarence:i must perforce. farewell.gloucester:go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.simple, plain clarence! i do love thee so,that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven,if heaven will take the present at our hands.but who comes here? the new-deliver'd hastings?hastings:good time of day unto my gracious lord!gloucester:as much unto my good lord chamberlain!well are you welcome to the open air.how hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?hastings:with patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:but i shall live, my lord, to give them thanksthat were the cause of my imprisonment.gloucester:no doubt, no doubt; and so shall clarence too;for they that were your enemies are his,and have prevail'd as much on him as you.hastings:more pity that the eagle should be mew'd,while kites and buzzards prey at liberty.gloucester:what news abroad?hastings:no news so bad abroad as this at home;the king is sickly, weak and melancholy,and his physicians fear him mightily.gloucester:now, by saint paul, this news is bad indeed.o, he hath kept an evil diet long,and overmuch consumed his royal person:'tis very grievous to be thought upon.what, is he in his bed?hastings:he is.gloucester:go you before, and i will follow you.he cannot live, i hope; and must not dietill george be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.i'll in, to urge his hatred more to clarence,with lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;and, if i fall not in my deep intent,clarence hath not another day to live:which done, god take king edward to his mercy,and leave the world for me to bustle in!for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter.what though i kill'd her husband and her father?the readiest way to make the wench amendsis to become her husband and her father:the which will i; not all so much for loveas for another secret close intent,by marrying her which i must reach unto.but yet i run before my horse to market:clarence still breathes; edward still lives and reigns:when they are gone, then must i count my gains.lady anne:set down, set down your honourable load,if honour may be shrouded in a hearse,whilst i awhile obsequiously lamentthe untimely fall of virtuous lancaster.poor key-cold figure of a holy king!pale ashes of the house of lancaster!thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost,to hear the lamentations of poor anne,wife to thy edward, to thy slaughter'd son,stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!more direful hap betide that hated wretch,that makes us wretched by the death of thee,than i can wish to adders, spiders, toads,or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!if ever he have child, abortive be it,prodigious, and untimely brought to light,whose ugly and unnatural aspectmay fright the hopeful mother at the view;and that be heir to his unhappiness!if ever he have wife, let her he madea miserable by the death of himas i am made by my poor lord and thee!come, now towards chertsey with your holy load,taken from paul's to be interred there;and still, as you are weary of the weight,rest you, whiles i lament king henry's corse.gloucester:stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.lady anne:what black magician conjures up this fiend,to stop devoted charitable deeds?gloucester:villains, set down the corse; or, by saint paul,i'll make a corse of him that disobeys.gentleman:my lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.gloucester:unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when i command:advance thy halbert higher than my breast,or, by saint paul, i'll strike thee to my foot,and spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.lady anne:what, do you tremble? are you all afraid?alas, i blame you not;

and slain by edward's hand.lady anne:in thy foul throat thou liest: queen margaret sawthy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;the which thou once didst bend against her breast,but that thy brothers beat aside the point.gloucester:i was provoked by her slanderous tongue,which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.lady anne:thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:didst thou not kill this king?gloucester:i grant ye.lady anne:dost grant me, hedgehog? then, god grant me toothou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!o, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!gloucester:the fitter for the king of heaven, that hath him.lady anne:he is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.gloucester:let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;for he was fitter for that place than earth.lady anne:and thou unfit for any place but hell.gloucester:yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.lady anne:some dungeon.gloucester:your bed-chamber.lady anne:i'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!gloucester:so will it, madam till i lie with you.lady anne:i hope so.gloucester:i know so. but, gentle lady anne,to leave this keen encounter of our wits,and fall somewhat into a slower method,is not the causer of the timeless deathsof these plantagenets, henry and edward,as blameful as the executioner?lady anne:thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.gloucester:your beauty was the cause of that effect;your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleepto undertake the death of all the world,so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom.lady anne:if i thought that, i tell thee, homicide,these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.gloucester:these eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;you should not blemish it, if i stood by:as all the world is cheered by the sun,so i by that; it is my day, my life.lady anne:black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!gloucester:curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.lady anne:i would i were, to be revenged on thee.gloucester:it is a quarrel most unnatural,to be revenged on him that loveth you.lady anne:it is a quarrel just and reasonable,to be revenged on him that slew my husband.gloucester:he that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,did it to help thee to a better husband.lady anne:his better doth not breathe upon the earth.gloucester:he lives that loves thee better than he could.lady anne:name him.gloucester:plantagenet.lady anne:why, that was he.gloucester:the selfsame name, but one of better nature.lady anne:where is he?gloucester:here.why dost thou spit at me?lady anne:would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!gloucester:never came poison from so sweet a place.lady anne:never hung poison on a fouler toad.out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.gloucester:thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.lady anne:would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!gloucester:i would they were, that i might die at once;for now they kill me with a living death.those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:these eyes that never shed remorseful tear,no, when my father york and edward wept,to hear the piteous moan that rutland madewhen black-faced clifford shook his sword at him;nor when thy warlike father, like a child,told the sad story of my father's death,and twenty times made pause to sob and weep,that all the standers-by had wet their cheekslike trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad timemy manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;and what these sorrows could not thence exhale,thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.i never sued to friend nor enemy;my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;but now thy beauty is proposed my fee,my proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were madefor kissing, lady, not for such contempt.if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,lo, here i lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.and let the soul forth that adoreth thee,i lay it naked to the deadly stroke,and humbly beg the death upon my knee.nay, do not pause; for i did kill king henry,but 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.nay, now dispatch; 'twas i that stabb'd young edward,but 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.take up the sword again, or take up me.lady anne:arise, dissembler: though i wish thy death,i will not be the executioner.gloucester:then bid me kill myself, and i will do it.lady anne:i have already.gloucester:tush, that was in thy rage:speak it again, and, even with the word,that hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.lady anne:i would i knew thy heart.gloucester:'tis figured in my tongue.lady anne:i fear me both are false.gloucester:then never man was true.lady anne:well, well, put up your sword.gloucester:say, then, my peace is made.lady anne:that shall you know hereafter.gloucester:but shall i live in hope?lady anne:all men, i hope, live so.gloucester:vouchsafe to wear this ring.lady anne:to take is not to give.gloucester:look, how this ring encompasseth finger.even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;wear both of them, for both of them are thine.and if thy poor devoted suppliant maybut beg one favour at thy gracious hand,thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.lady anne:what is it?gloucester:that it would please thee leave these sad designsto him that hath more cause to be a mourner,and presently repair to crosby place;where, after i have solemnly interr'dat chertsey monastery this noble king,and wet his grave with my repentant tears,i will with all expedient duty see you:for divers unknown reasons. i beseech you,grant me this boon.lady anne:with all my heart; and much it joys me too,to see you are become so penitent.tressel and berkeley, go along with me.gloucester:bid me farewell.lady anne:'tis more than you deserve;but since you teach me how to flatter you,imagine i have said farewell already.gloucester:sirs, take up the corse.gentlemen:towards chertsey, noble lord?gloucester:no, to white-friars;

his grace speaks cheerfully.queen elizabeth:god grant him health! did you confer with him?buckingham:madam, we did: he desires to make atonementbetwixt the duke of gloucester and your brothers,and betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;and sent to warn them to his royal presence.queen elizabeth:would all were well! but that will never bei fear our happiness is at the highest.gloucester:they do me wrong, and i will not endure it:who are they that complain unto the king,that i, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?by holy paul, they love his grace but lightlythat fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.because i cannot flatter and speak fair,smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,duck with french nods and apish courtesy,i must be held a rancorous enemy.cannot a plain man live and think no harm,but thus his simple truth must be abusedby silken, sly, insinuating jacks?rivers:to whom in all this presence speaks your grace?gloucester:to thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.when have i injured thee? when done thee wrong?or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?a plague upon you all! his royal person,--whom god preserve better than you would wish!--cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,but you must trouble him with lewd complaints.queen elizabeth:brother of gloucester, you mistake the matter.the king, of his own royal disposition,and not provoked by any suitor else;aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,which in your outward actions shows itselfagainst my kindred, brothers, and myself,makes him to send; that thereby he may gatherthe ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.gloucester:i cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:since every jack became a gentlemanthere's many a gentle person made a jack.queen elizabeth:come, come, we know your meaning, brothergloucester;you envy my advancement and my friends':god grant we never may have need of you!gloucester:meantime, god grants that we have need of you:your brother is imprison'd by your means,myself disgraced, and the nobilityheld in contempt; whilst many fair promotionsare daily given to ennoble thosethat scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.queen elizabeth:by him that raised me to this careful heightfrom that contented hap which i enjoy'd,i never did incense his majestyagainst the duke of clarence, but have beenan earnest advocate to plead for him.my lord, you do me shameful injury,falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.gloucester:you may deny that you were not the causeof my lord hastings' late imprisonment.rivers:she may, my lord, for--gloucester:she may, lord rivers! why, who knows not so?she may do more, sir, than denying that:she may help you to many fair preferments,and then deny her aiding hand therein,and lay those honours on your high deserts.what may she not? she may, yea, marry, may she--rivers:what, marry, may she?gloucester:what, marry, may she! marry with a king,a bachelor, a handsome stripling too:i wis your grandam had a worser match.queen elizabeth:my lord of gloucester, i have too long borneyour blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:by heaven, i will acquaint his majestywith those gross taunts i often have endured.i had rather be a country servant-maidthan a great queen, with this condition,to be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:small joy have i in being england's queen.queen margaret:and lessen'd be that small, god, i beseech thee!thy honour, state and seat is due to me.gloucester:what! threat you me with telling of the king?tell him, and spare not: look, what i have saidi will avouch in presence of the king:i dare adventure to be sent to the tower.'tis time to speak;

but i do find more pain in banishmentthan death can yield me here by my abode.a husband and a son thou owest to me;and thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:the sorrow that i have, by right is yours,and all the pleasures you usurp are mine.gloucester:the curse my noble father laid on thee,when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paperand with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,and then, to dry them, gavest the duke a cloutsteep'd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland--his curses, then from bitterness of souldenounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;and god, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.queen elizabeth:so just is god, to right the innocent.hastings:o, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,and the most merciless that e'er was heard of!rivers:tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.dorset:no man but prophesied revenge for it.buckingham:northumberland, then present, wept to see it.queen margaret:what were you snarling all before i came,ready to catch each other by the throat,and turn you all your hatred now on me?did york's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?that henry's death, my lovely edward's death,their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,could all but answer for that peevish brat?can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!if not by war, by surfeit die your king,as ours by murder, to make him a king!edward thy son, which now is prince of wales,for edward my son, which was prince of wales,die in his youth by like untimely violence!thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;and see another, as i see thee now,deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!long die thy happy days before thy death;and, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,die neither mother, wife, nor england's queen!rivers and dorset, you were standers by,and so wast thou, lord hastings, when my sonwas stabb'd with bloody daggers: god, i pray him,that none of you may live your natural age,but by some unlook'd accident cut off!gloucester:have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!queen margaret:and leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.if heaven have any grievous plague in storeexceeding those that i can wish upon thee,o, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,and then hurl down their indignationon thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,unless it be whilst some tormenting dreamaffrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!thou that wast seal'd in thy nativitythe slave of nature and the son of hell!thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!thou rag of honour! thou detested--gloucester:margaret.queen margaret:richard!gloucester:ha!queen margaret:i call thee not.gloucester:i cry thee mercy then, for i had thoughtthat thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.queen margaret:why, so i did;

and when he bites,his venom tooth will rankle to the death:have not to do with him, beware of him;sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,and all their ministers attend on him.gloucester:what doth she say, my lord of buckingham?buckingham:nothing that i respect, my gracious lord.queen margaret:what, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?and soothe the devil that i warn thee from?o, but remember this another day,when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,and say poor margaret was a prophetess!live each of you the subjects to his hate,and he to yours, and all of you to god's!hastings:my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.rivers:and so doth mine: i muse why she's at liberty.gloucester:i cannot blame her: by god's holy mother,she hath had too much wrong; and i repentmy part thereof that i have done to her.queen elizabeth:i never did her any, to my knowledge.gloucester:but you have all the vantage of her wrong.i was too hot to do somebody good,that is too cold in thinking of it now.marry, as for clarence, he is well repaid,he is frank'd up to fatting for his painsgod pardon them that are the cause of it!rivers:a virtuous and a christian-like conclusion,to pray for them that have done scathe to us.gloucester:so do i ever:being well-advised.for had i cursed now, i had cursed myself.catesby:madam, his majesty doth call for you,and for your grace; and you, my noble lords.queen elizabeth:catesby, we come. lords, will you go with us?rivers:madam, we will attend your grace.gloucester:i do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.the secret mischiefs that i set abroachi lay unto the grievous charge of others.clarence, whom i, indeed, have laid in darkness,i do beweep to many simple gullsnamely, to hastings, derby, buckingham;and say it is the queen and her alliesthat stir the king against the duke my brother.now, they believe it; and withal whet meto be revenged on rivers, vaughan, grey:but then i sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,tell them that god bids us do good for evil:and thus i clothe my naked villanywith old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;and seem a saint, when most i play the devil.but, soft! here come my executioners.how now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!are you now going to dispatch this deed?first murderer:we are, my lord; and come to have the warrantthat we may be admitted where he is.gloucester:well thought upon; i have it here about me.when you have done, repair to crosby place.but, sirs, be sudden in the execution,withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;for clarence is well-spoken, and perhapsmay move your hearts to pity if you mark him.first murderer:tush!fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;talkers are no good doers: be assuredwe come to use our hands and not our tongues.gloucester:your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:i like you, lads; about your business straight;go, go, dispatch.first murderer:we will, my noble lord.brakenbury:why looks your grace so heavily today?clarence:o, i have pass'd a miserable night,so full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,that, as i am a christian faithful man,i would not spend another such a night,though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,so full of dismal terror was the time!brakenbury:what was your dream? i long to hear you tell it.clarence:methoughts that i had broken from the tower,and was embark'd to cross to burgundy;and, in my company, my brother gloucester;who from my cabin tempted me to walkupon the hatches: thence we looked toward england,and cited up a thousand fearful times,during the wars of york and lancasterthat had befall'n us. as we paced alongupon the giddy footing of the hatches,methought that gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,into the tumbling billows of the main.lord, lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!what ugly sights of death within mine eyes!methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks;ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,all scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holeswhere eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,as 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,and mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.brakenbury:had you such leisure in the time of deathto gaze upon the secrets of the deep?clarence:methought i had; and often did i striveto yield the ghost: but still the envious floodkept in my soul, and would not let it forthto seek the empty, vast and wandering air;but smother'd it within my panting bulk,which almost burst to belch it in the sea.brakenbury:awaked you not with this sore agony?clarence:o, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;o, then began the tempest to my soul,who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,with that grim ferryman which poets write of,unto the kingdom of perpetual night.the first that there did greet my stranger soul,was my great father-in-law, renowned warwick;who cried aloud, 'what scourge for perjurycan this dark monarchy afford false clarence?'and so he vanish'd: then came wandering bya shadow like an angel, with bright hairdabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,'clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured clarence,that stabb'd me in the field by tewksbury;seize on him, furies, take him to your torments!'with that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiendsenviron'd me about, and howled in mine earssuch hideous cries, that with the very noisei trembling waked, and for a season aftercould not believe but that i was in hell,such terrible impression made the dream.brakenbury:no marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;i promise, i am afraid to hear you tell it.clarence:o brakenbury, i have done those things,which now bear evidence against my soul,for edward's sake; and see how he requites me!o god! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,yet execute thy wrath in me alone,o, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!i pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;my soul is heavy, and i fain would sleep.brakenbury:i will, my lord: god give your grace good rest!sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.princes have but their tides for their glories,an outward honour for an inward toil;and, for unfelt imagination,they often feel a world of restless cares:so that, betwixt their tides and low names,there's nothing differs but the outward fame.first murderer:ho! who's here?brakenbury:in god's name what are you, and how came you hither?first murderer:i would speak with clarence, and i came hither on my legs.brakenbury:yea, are you so brief?second murderer:o sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. showhim our commission; talk no more.brakenbury:i am, in this, commanded to deliverthe noble duke of clarence to your hands:i will not reason what is meant hereby,because i will be guiltless of the meaning.here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:i'll to the king; and signify to himthat thus i have resign'd my charge to you.first murderer:do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.second murderer:what, shall we stab him as he sleeps?first murderer:no; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.second murderer:when he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake tillthe judgment-day.first murderer:why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.second murderer:the urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kindof remorse in me.first murderer:what, art thou afraid?second murderer:not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to bedamned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.first murderer:i thought thou hadst been resolute.second murderer:so i am, to let him live.first murderer:back to the duke of gloucester, tell him so.second murderer:i pray thee, stay a while: i hope my holy humourwill change; 'twas wont to hold me but while onewould tell twenty.first murderer:how dost thou feel thyself now?second murderer:'faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yetwithin me.first murderer:remember our reward, when the deed is done.second murderer:'zounds, he dies: i had forgot the reward.first murderer:where is thy conscience now?second murderer:in the duke of gloucester's purse.first murderer:so when he opens his purse to give us our reward,thy conscience flies out.second murderer:let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.first murderer:how if it come to thee again?second murderer:i'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: itmakes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but itaccuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but itdetects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit thatmutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full ofobstacles: it made me once restore a purse of goldthat i found; it beggars any man that keeps it: itis turned out of all towns and cities for adangerous thing; and every man that means to livewell endeavours to trust to himself and to livewithout it.first murderer:'zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading menot to kill the duke.second murderer:take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: hewould insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.first murderer:tut, i am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,i warrant thee.second murderer:spoke like a tail fellow that respects hisreputation. come, shall we to this gear?first murderer:take him over the costard with the hilts of thysword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-buttin the next room.second murderer:o excellent devise! make a sop of him.first murderer:hark! he stirs: shall i strike?second murderer:no, first let's reason with him.clarence:where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.second murderer:you shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.clarence:in god's name, what art thou?second murderer:a man, as you are.clarence:but not, as i am, royal.second murderer:nor you, as we are, loyal.clarence:thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.second murderer:my voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.clarence:how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?who sent you hither? wherefore do you come?both:to, to, to--clarence:to murder me?both:ay, ay.clarence:you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.wherein, my friends, have i offended you?first murderer:offended us you have not, but the king.clarence:i shall be reconciled to him again.second murderer:never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.clarence:are you call'd forth from out a world of mento slay the innocent? what is my offence?where are the evidence that do accuse me?what lawful quest have given their verdict upunto the frowning judge? or who pronouncedthe bitter sentence of poor clarence' death?before i be convict by course of law,to threaten me with death is most unlawful.i charge you, as you hope to have redemptionby christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,that you depart and lay no hands on methe deed you undertake is damnable.first murderer:what we will do, we do upon command.second murderer:and he that hath commanded is the king.clarence:erroneous vassal! the great king of kingshath in the tables of his law commandedthat thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,to hurl upon their heads that break his law.second murderer:and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,for false forswearing and for murder too:thou didst receive the holy sacrament,to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster.first murderer:and, like a traitor to the name of god,didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous bladeunrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.second murderer:whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.first murderer:how canst thou urge god's dreadful law to us,when thou hast broke it in so dear degree?clarence:alas! for whose sake did i that ill deed?for edward, for my brother, for his sake: why, sirs,he sends ye not to murder me for thisfor in this sin he is as deep as i.if god will be revenged for this deed.o, know you yet, he doth it publicly,take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;he needs no indirect nor lawless courseto cut off those that have offended him.first murderer:who made thee, then, a bloody minister,when gallant-springing brave plantagenet,that princely novice, was struck dead by thee?clarence:my brother's love, the devil, and my rage.first murderer:thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.clarence:oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;i am his brother, and i love him well.if you be hired for meed, go back again,and i will send you to my brother gloucester,who shall reward you better for my lifethan edward will for tidings of my death.second murderer:you are deceived, your brother gloucester hates you.clarence:o, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:go you to him from me.both:ay, so we will.clarence:tell him, when that our princely father yorkbless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,and charged us from his soul to love each other,he little thought of this divided friendship:bid gloucester think of this, and he will weep.first murderer:ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.clarence:o, do not slander him, for he is kind.first murderer:right,as snow in harvest. thou deceivest thyself:'tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.clarence:it cannot be; for when i parted with him,he hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,that he would labour my delivery.second murderer:why, so he doth, now he delivers theefrom this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.first murderer:make peace with god, for you must die, my lord.clarence:hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,to counsel me to make my peace with god,and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,that thou wilt war with god by murdering me?ah, sirs, consider, he that set you onto do this deed will hate you for the deed.second murderer:what shall we do?clarence:relent, and save your souls.first murderer:relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.clarence:not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.which of you, if you were a prince's son,being pent from liberty, as i am now,if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,would not entreat for life?my friend, i spy some pity in thy looks:o, if thine eye be not a flatterer,come thou on my side, and entreat for me,as you would beg, were you in my distressa begging prince what beggar pities not?second murderer:look behind you, my lord.first murderer:take that, and that: if all this will not do,i'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.second murderer:a bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!how fain, like pilate, would i wash my handsof this most grievous guilty murder done!first murderer:how now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?by heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!second murderer:i would he knew that i had saved his brother!take thou the fee, and tell him what i say;for i repent me that the duke is slain.first murderer:so do not i: go, coward as thou art.now must i hide his body in some hole,until the duke take order for his burial:and when i have my meed, i must away;for this will out, and here i must not stay.king edward iv:why, so: now have i done a good day's work:you peers, continue this united league:i every day expect an embassagefrom my redeemer to redeem me hence;and now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,since i have set my friends at peace on earth.rivers and hastings, take each other's hand;dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.rivers:by heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:and with my hand i seal my true heart's love.hastings:so thrive i, as i truly swear the like!king edward iv:take heed you dally not before your king;lest he that is the supreme king of kingsconfound your hidden falsehood, and awardeither of you to be the other's end.hastings:so prosper i, as i swear perfect love!rivers:and i, as i love hastings with my heart!king edward iv:madam, yourself are not exempt in this,nor your son dorset, buckingham, nor you;you have been factious one against the other,wife, love lord hastings, let him kiss your hand;and what you do, do it unfeignedly.queen elizabeth:here, hastings; i will never more rememberour former hatred, so thrive i and mine!king edward iv:dorset, embrace him; hastings, love lord marquess.dorset:this interchange of love, i here protest,upon my part shall be unviolable.hastings:and so swear i, my lordking edward iv:now, princely buckingham, seal thou this leaguewith thy embracements to my wife's allies,and make me happy in your unity.buckingham:whenever buckingham doth turn his hateon you or yours,but with all duteous lovedoth cherish you and yours, god punish mewith hate in those where i expect most love!when i have most need to employ a friend,and most assured that he is a frienddeep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,be he unto me! this do i beg of god,when i am cold in zeal to yours.king edward iv:a pleasing cordial, princely buckingham,is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.there wanteth now our brother gloucester here,to make the perfect period of this peace.buckingham:and, in good time, here comes the noble duke.gloucester:good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:and, princely peers, a happy time of day!king edward iv:happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.brother, we done deeds of charity;made peace enmity, fair love of hate,between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.gloucester:a blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:amongst this princely heap, if any here,by false intelligence, or wrong surmise,hold me a foe;if i unwittingly, or in my rage,have aught committed that is hardly borneby any in this presence, i desireto reconcile me to his friendly peace:'tis death to me to be at enmity;i hate it, and desire all good men's love.first, madam, i entreat true peace of you,which i will purchase with my duteous service;of you, my noble cousin buckingham,if ever any grudge were lodged between us;of you, lord rivers, and, lord grey, of you;that without desert have frown'd on me;dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.i do not know that englishman alivewith whom my soul is any jot at oddsmore than the infant that is born to-nighti thank my god for my humility.queen elizabeth:a holy day shall this be kept hereafter:i would to god all strifes were well compounded.my sovereign liege, i do beseech your majestyto take our brother clarence to your grace.gloucester:why, madam, have i offer'd love for thisto be so bouted in this royal presence?who knows not that the noble duke is dead?you do him injury to scorn his corse.rivers:who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?queen elizabeth:all seeing heaven, what a world is this!buckingham:look i so pale, lord dorset, as the rest?dorset:ay, my good lord; and no one in this presencebut his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.king edward iv:is clarence dead? the order was reversed.gloucester:but he, poor soul, by your first order died,and that a winged mercury did bear:some tardy cripple bore the countermand,that came too lag to see him buried.god grant that some, less noble and less loyal,nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,deserve not worse than wretched clarence did,and yet go current from suspicion!dorset:a boon, my sovereign, for my service done!king edward iv:i pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.dorset:i will not rise, unless your highness grant.king edward iv:then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.dorset:the forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;who slew to-day a righteous gentlemanlately attendant on the duke of norfolk.king edward iv:have a tongue to doom my brother's death,and shall the same give pardon to a slave?my brother slew no man; his fault was thought,and yet his punishment was cruel death.who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advisedwho spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?who told me how the poor soul did forsakethe mighty warwick, and did fight for me?who told me, in the field by tewksburywhen oxford had me down, he rescued me,and said, 'dear brother, live, and be a king'?who told me, when we both lay in the fieldfrozen almost to death, how he did lap meeven in his own garments, and gave himself,all thin and naked, to the numb cold night?all this from my remembrance brutish wrathsinfully pluck'd, and not a man of youhad so much grace to put it in my mind.but when your carters or your waiting-vassalshave done a drunken slaughter, and defacedthe precious image of our dear redeemer,you straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;and i unjustly too, must grant it youbut for my brother not a man would speak,nor i, ungracious, speak unto myselffor him, poor soul. the proudest of you allhave been beholding to him in his life;yet none of you would once plead for his life.o god, i fear thy justice will take holdon me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!come, hastings, help me to my closet.oh, poor clarence!gloucester:this is the fruit of rashness! mark'd you nothow that the guilty kindred of the queenlook'd pale when they did hear of clarence' death?o, they did urge it still unto the king!god will revenge it. but come, let us in,to comfort edward with our company.buckingham:we wait upon your grace.boy:tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?duchess of york:no, boy.boy:why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,and cry 'o clarence, my unhappy son!'girl:why do you look on us, and shake your head,and call us wretches, orphans, castawaysif that our noble father be alive?duchess of york:my pretty cousins, you mistake me much;i do lament the sickness of the king.as loath to lose him, not your father's death;it were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.boy:then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.the king my uncle is to blame for this:god will revenge it;

for my good uncle gloucestertold me, the king, provoked by the queen,devised impeachments to imprison him :and when my uncle told me so, he wept,and hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;bade me rely on him as on my father,and he would love me dearly as his child.duchess of york:oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!he is my son; yea, and therein my shame;yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.boy:think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?duchess of york:ay, boy.boy:i cannot think it. hark! what noise is this?queen elizabeth:oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,to chide my fortune, and torment myself?i'll join with black despair against my soul,and to myself become an enemy.duchess of york:what means this scene of rude impatience?queen elizabeth:to make an act of tragic violence:edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?if you will live, lament; if die, be brief,that our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;or, like obedient subjects, follow himto his new kingdom of perpetual rest.duchess of york:ah, so much interest have i in thy sorrowas i had title in thy noble husband!i have bewept a worthy husband's death,and lived by looking on his images:but now two mirrors of his princely semblanceare crack'd in pieces by malignant death,and i for comfort have but one false glass,which grieves me when i see my shame in him.thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,and hast the comfort of thy children left thee:but death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,and pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,edward and clarence. o, what cause have i,thine being but a moiety of my grief,to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!boy:good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;how can we aid you with our kindred tears?girl:our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!queen elizabeth:give me no help in lamentation;i am not barren to bring forth complaintsall springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,that i, being govern'd by the watery moon,may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!oh for my husband, for my dear lord edward!children:oh for our father, for our dear lord clarence!duchess of york:alas for both, both mine, edward and clarence!queen elizabeth:what stay had i but edward? and he's gone.children:what stay had we but clarence? and he's gone.duchess of york:what stays had i but they? and they are gone.queen elizabeth:was never widow had so dear a loss!children:were never orphans had so dear a loss!duchess of york:was never mother had so dear a loss!alas, i am the mother of these moans!their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.she for an edward weeps, and so do i;i for a clarence weep, so doth not she:these babes for clarence weep and so do i;i for an edward weep, so do not they:alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,pour all your tears! i am your sorrow's nurse,and i will pamper it with lamentations.dorset:comfort, dear mother: god is much displeasedthat you take with unthankfulness, his doing:in common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,with dull unwilligness to repay a debtwhich with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;much more to be thus opposite with heaven,for it requires the royal debt it lent you.rivers:madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,of the young prince your son: send straight for himlet him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:drown desperate sorrow in dead edward's grave,and plant your joys in living edward's throne.gloucester:madam, have comfort: all of us have causeto wail the dimming of our shining star;but none can cure their harms by wailing them.madam, my mother, i do cry you mercy;i did not see your grace: humbly on my kneei crave your blessing.duchess of york:god bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,love, charity, obedience, and true duty!gloucester:buckingham:you cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,that bear this mutual heavy load of moan,now cheer each other in each other's lovethough we have spent our harvest of this king,we are to reap the harvest of his son.the broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,but lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:me seemeth good, that, with some little train,forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetch'dhither to london, to be crown'd our king.rivers:why with some little train, my lord of buckingham?buckingham:marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,the new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,which would be so much the more dangerousby how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:where every horse bears his commanding rein,and may direct his course as please himself,as well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,in my opinion, ought to be prevented.gloucester:i hope the king made peace with all of usand the compact is firm and true in me.rivers:and so in me; and so, i think, in all:yet, since it is but green, it should be putto no apparent likelihood of breach,which haply by much company might be urged:therefore i say with noble buckingham,that it is meet so few should fetch the prince.hastings:and so say i.gloucester:then be it so; and go we to determinewho they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow.madam, and you, my mother, will you goto give your censures in this weighty business?queen elizabeth:with all our harts.buckingham:my lord, whoever journeys to the prince,for god's sake, let not us two be behind;for, by the way, i'll sort occasion,as index to the story we late talk'd of,to part the queen's proud kindred from the king.gloucester:my other self, my counsel's consistory,my oracle, my prophet! my dear cousin,i, like a child, will go by thy direction.towards ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.first citizen:neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?second citizen:i promise you, i scarcely know myself:hear you the news abroad?first citizen:ay, that the king is dead.second citizen:bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:i fear, i fear 'twill prove a troublous world.third citizen:neighbours, god speed!first citizen:give you good morrow, sir.third citizen:doth this news hold of good king edward's death?second citizen:ay, sir, it is too true; god help the while!third citizen:then, masters, look to see a troublous world.first citizen:no, no; by god's good grace his son shall reign.third citizen:woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!second citizen:in him there is a hope of government,that in his nonage council under him,and in his full and ripen'd years himself,no doubt, shall then and till then govern well.first citizen:so stood the state when henry the sixthwas crown'd in paris but at nine months old.third citizen:stood the state so? no, no, good friends, god wot;for then this land was famously enrich'dwith politic grave counsel; then the kinghad virtuous uncles to protect his grace.first citizen:why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.third citizen:better it were they all came by the father,or by the father there were none at all;for emulation now, who shall be nearest,will touch us all too near, if god prevent not.o, full of danger is the duke of gloucester!and the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:and were they to be ruled, and not to rule,this sickly land might solace as before.first citizen:come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.third citizen:when clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;when great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;when the sun sets, who doth not look for night?untimely storms make men expect a dearth.all may be well; but, if god sort it so,'tis more than we deserve, or i expect.second citizen:truly, the souls of men are full of dread:ye cannot reason almost with a manthat looks not heavily and full of fear.third citizen:before the times of change, still is it so:by a divine instinct men's minds mistrustensuing dangers; as by proof, we seethe waters swell before a boisterous storm.but leave it all to god. whither away?second citizen:marry, we were sent for to the justices.third citizen:and so was i: i'll bear you company.archbishop of york:last night, i hear, they lay at northampton;at stony-stratford will they be to-night:to-morrow, or next day, they will be here.duchess of york:i long with all my heart to see the prince:i hope he is much grown since last i saw him.queen elizabeth:but i hear, no; they say my son of yorkhath almost overta'en him in his growth.york:ay, mother; but i would not have it so.duchess of york:why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.york:grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,my uncle rivers talk'd how i did growmore than my brother: 'ay,' quoth my unclegloucester,'small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'and since, methinks, i would not grow so fast,because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.duchess of york:good faith, good faith, the saying did not holdin him that did object the same to thee;he was the wretched'st thing when he was young,so long a-growing and so leisurely,that, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.archbishop of york:why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.duchess of york:i hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.york:now, by my troth, if i had been remember'd,i could have given my uncle's grace a flout,to touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.duchess of york:how, my pretty york? i pray thee, let me hear it.york:marry, they say my uncle grew so fastthat he could gnaw a crust at two hours old'twas full two years ere i could get a tooth.grandam, this would have been a biting jest.duchess of york:i pray thee, pretty york, who told thee this?york:grandam, his nurse.duchess of york:his nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.york:if 'twere not she, i cannot tell who told me.queen elizabeth:a parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.archbishop of york:good madam, be not angry with the child.queen elizabeth:pitchers have ears.archbishop of york:here comes a messenger. what news?messenger:such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.queen elizabeth:how fares the prince?messenger:well, madam, and in health.duchess of york:what is thy news then?messenger:lord rivers and lord grey are sent to pomfret,with them sir thomas vaughan, prisoners.duchess of york:who hath committed them?messenger:the mighty dukesgloucester and buckingham.queen elizabeth:for what offence?messenger:the sum of all i can, i have disclosed;why or for what these nobles were committedis all unknown to me, my gracious lady.queen elizabeth:ay me, i see the downfall of our house!the tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;insulting tyranny begins to jetupon the innocent and aweless throne:welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!i see, as in a map, the end of all.duchess of york:accursed and unquiet wrangling days,how many of you have mine eyes beheld!my husband lost his life to get the crown;and often up and down my sons were toss'd,for me to joy and weep their gain and loss:and being seated, and domestic broilsclean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.make war upon themselves; blood against blood,self against self: o, preposterousand frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;or let me die, to look on death no more!queen elizabeth:come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.madam, farewell.duchess of york:i'll go along with you.queen elizabeth:you have no cause.archbishop of york:my gracious lady, go;and thither bear your treasure and your goods.for my part, i'll resign unto your gracethe seal i keep: and so betide to meas well i tender you and all of yours!come, i'll conduct you to the sanctuary.buckingham:welcome, sweet prince, to london, to your chamber.gloucester:welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereignthe weary way hath made you melancholy.prince edward:no, uncle; but our crosses on the wayhave made it tedious, wearisome, and heavyi want more uncles here to welcome me.gloucester:sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your yearshath not yet dived into the world's deceitnor more can you distinguish of a manthan of his outward show; which, god he knows,seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.those uncles which you want were dangerous;your grace attended to their sugar'd words,but look'd not on the poison of their hearts :god keep you from them, and from such false friends!prince edward:god keep me from false friends! but they were none.gloucester:my lord, the mayor of london comes to greet you.lord mayor:god bless your grace with health and happy days!prince edward:i thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.i thought my mother, and my brother york,would long ere this have met us on the wayfie, what a slug is hastings, that he comes notto tell us whether they will come or no!buckingham:and, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.prince edward:welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?hastings:on what occasion, god he knows, not i,the queen your mother, and your brother york,have taken sanctuary: the tender princewould fain have come with me to meet your grace,but by his mother was perforce withheld.buckingham:fie, what an indirect and peevish courseis this of hers! lord cardinal, will your gracepersuade the queen to send the duke of yorkunto his princely brother presently?if she deny, lord hastings, go with him,and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.cardinal:my lord of buckingham, if my weak oratorycan from his mother win the duke of york,anon expect him here; but if she be obdurateto mild entreaties, god in heaven forbidwe should infringe the holy privilegeof blessed sanctuary! not for all this landwould i be guilty of so deep a sin.buckingham:you are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,too ceremonious and traditionalweigh it but with the grossness of this age,you break not sanctuary in seizing him.the benefit thereof is always grantedto those whose dealings have deserved the place,and those who have the wit to claim the place:this prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;and therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:then, taking him from thence that is not there,you break no privilege nor charter there.oft have i heard of sanctuary men;but sanctuary children ne'er till now.cardinal:my lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.come on, lord hastings, will you go with me?hastings:i go, my lord.prince edward:good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.say, uncle gloucester, if our brother come,where shall we sojourn till our coronation?gloucester:where it seems best unto your royal self.if i may counsel you, some day or twoyour highness shall repose you at the tower:then where you please, and shall be thought most fitfor your best health and recreation.prince edward:i do not like the tower, of any place.did julius caesar build that place, my lord?buckingham:he did, my gracious lord, begin that place;which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.prince edward:is it upon record, or else reportedsuccessively from age to age, he built it?buckingham:upon record, my gracious lord.prince edward:but say, my lord, it were not register'd,methinks the truth should live from age to age,as 'twere retail'd to all posterity,even to the general all-ending day.gloucester:prince edward:what say you, uncle?gloucester:i say, without characters, fame lives long.thus, like the formal vice, iniquity,i moralize two meanings in one word.prince edward:that julius caesar was a famous man;with what his valour did enrich his wit,his wit set down to make his valour livedeath makes no conquest of this conqueror;for now he lives in fame, though not in life.i'll tell you what, my cousin buckingham,--buckingham:what, my gracious lord?prince edward:an if i live until i be a man,i'll win our ancient right in france again,or die a soldier, as i lived a king.gloucester:buckingham:now, in good time, here comes the duke of york.prince edward:richard of york! how fares our loving brother?york:well, my dread lord; so must i call you now.prince edward:ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:too late he died that might have kept that title,which by his death hath lost much majesty.gloucester:how fares our cousin, noble lord of york?york:i thank you, gentle uncle. o, my lord,you said that idle weeds are fast in growththe prince my brother hath outgrown me far.gloucester:he hath, my lord.york:and therefore is he idle?gloucester:o, my fair cousin, i must not say so.york:then is he more beholding to you than i.gloucester:he may command me as my sovereign;but you have power in me as in a kinsman.york:i pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.gloucester:my dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.prince edward:a beggar, brother?york:of my kind uncle, that i know will give;and being but a toy, which is no grief to give.gloucester:a greater gift than that i'll give my cousin.york:a greater gift! o, that's the sword to it.gloucester:a gentle cousin, were it light enough.york:o, then, i see, you will part but with light gifts;in weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.gloucester:it is too heavy for your grace to wear.york:i weigh it lightly, were it heavier.gloucester:what, would you have my weapon, little lord?york:i would, that i might thank you as you call me.gloucester:how?york:little.prince edward:my lord of york will still be cross in talk:uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.york:you mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;because that i am little, like an ape,he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.buckingham:with what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,he prettily and aptly taunts himself:so cunning and so young is wonderful.gloucester:my lord, will't please you pass along?myself and my good cousin buckinghamwill to your mother, to entreat of herto meet you at the tower and welcome you.york:what, will you go unto the tower, my lord?prince edward:my lord protector needs will have it so.york:i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower.gloucester:why, what should you fear?york:marry, my uncle clarence' angry ghost:my grandam told me he was murdered there.prince edward:i fear no uncles dead.gloucester:nor none that live, i hope.prince edward:an if they live, i hope i need not fear.but come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,thinking on them, go i unto the tower.buckingham:think you, my lord, this little prating yorkwas not incensed by his subtle motherto taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?gloucester:no doubt, no doubt; o, 'tis a parlous boy;bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capablehe is all the mother's, from the top to toe.buckingham:well, let them rest. come hither, catesby.thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intendas closely to conceal what we impart:thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;what think'st thou? is it not an easy matterto make william lord hastings of our mind,for the instalment of this noble dukein the seat royal of this famous isle?catesby:he for his father's sake so loves the prince,that he will not be won to aught against him.buckingham:what think'st thou, then, of stanley? what will he?catesby:he will do all in all as hastings doth.buckingham:well, then, no more but this: go, gentle catesby,and, as it were far off sound thou lord hastings,how doth he stand affected to our purpose;and summon him to-morrow to the tower,to sit about the coronation.if thou dost find him tractable to us,encourage him, and show him all our reasons:if he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,be thou so too; and so break off your talk,and give us notice of his inclination:for we to-morrow hold divided councils,wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.gloucester:commend me to lord william: tell him, catesby,his ancient knot of dangerous adversariesto-morrow are let blood at pomfret-castle;and bid my friend, for joy of this good news,give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more.buckingham:good catesby, go, effect this business soundly.catesby:my good lords both, with all the heed i may.gloucester:shall we hear from you, catesby, ere we sleep?catesby:you shall, my lord.gloucester:at crosby place, there shall you find us both.buckingham:now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceivelord hastings will not yield to our complots?gloucester:chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:and, look, when i am king, claim thou of methe earldom of hereford, and the moveableswhereof the king my brother stood possess'd.buckingham:i'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.gloucester:and look to have it yielded with all willingness.come, let us sup betimes, that afterwardswe may digest our complots in some form.messenger:what, ho! my lord!hastings:messenger:a messenger from the lord stanley.hastings:what is't o'clock?messenger:upon the stroke of four.hastings:cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?messenger:so it should seem by that i have to say.first, he commends him to your noble lordship.hastings:and then?messenger:and then he sends you wordhe dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:besides, he says there are two councils held;and that may be determined at the onewhich may make you and him to rue at the other.therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,if presently you will take horse with him,and with all speed post with him toward the north,to shun the danger that his soul divines.hastings:go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;bid him not fear the separated councilshis honour and myself are at the one,and at the other is my servant catesbywhere nothing can proceed that toucheth uswhereof i shall not have intelligence.tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:and for his dreams, i wonder he is so fondto trust the mockery of unquiet slumbersto fly the boar before the boar pursues,were to incense the boar to follow usand make pursuit where he did mean no chase.go, bid thy master rise and come to meand we will both together to the tower,where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.messenger:my gracious lord, i'll tell him what you say.catesby:many good morrows to my noble lord!hastings:good morrow, catesby; you are early stirringwhat news, what news, in this our tottering state?catesby:it is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;and i believe twill never stand uprighttim richard wear the garland of the realm.hastings:how! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?catesby:ay, my good lord.hastings:i'll have this crown of mine cut from my shouldersere i will see the crown so foul misplaced.but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?catesby:ay, on my life; and hopes to find forwardupon his party for the gain thereof:and thereupon he sends you this good news,that this same very day your enemies,the kindred of the queen, must die at pomfret.hastings:indeed, i am no mourner for that news,because they have been still mine enemies:but, that i'll give my voice on richard's side,to bar my master's heirs in true descent,god knows i will not do it, to the death.catesby:god keep your lordship in that gracious mind!hastings:but i shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,that they who brought me in my master's hatei live to look upon their tragedy.i tell thee, catesby--catesby:what, my lord?hastings:ere a fortnight make me elder,i'll send some packing that yet think not on it.catesby:'tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,when men are unprepared and look not for it.hastings:o monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it outwith rivers, vaughan, grey: and so 'twill dowith some men else, who think themselves as safeas thou and i; who, as thou know'st, are dearto princely richard and to buckingham.catesby:the princes both make high account of you;for they account his head upon the bridge.hastings:i know they do; and i have well deserved it.come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?stanley:my lord, good morrow; good morrow, catesby:you may jest on, but, by the holy rood,i do not like these several councils, i.hastings:my lord,i hold my life as dear as you do yours;and never in my life, i do protest,was it more precious to me than 'tis now:think you, but that i know our state secure,i would be so triumphant as i am?stanley:the lords at pomfret, when they rode from london,were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,and they indeed had no cause to mistrust;but yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.this sudden stag of rancour i misdoubt:pray god, i say, i prove a needless coward!what, shall we toward the tower? the day is spent.hastings:come, come, have with you. wot you what, my lord?to-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.lord stanley:they, for their truth, might better wear their headsthan some that have accused them wear their hats.but come, my lord, let us away.hastings:go on before; i'll talk with this good fellow.how now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?pursuivant:the better that your lordship please to ask.hastings:i tell thee, man, 'tis better with me nowthan when i met thee last where now we meet:then was i going prisoner to the tower,by the suggestion of the queen's allies;but now, i tell thee--keep it to thyself--this day those enemies are put to death,and i in better state than e'er i was.pursuivant:god hold it, to your honour's good content!hastings:gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.pursuivant:god save your lordship!priest:well met, my lord; i am glad to see your honour.hastings:i thank thee, good sir john, with all my heart.i am in your debt for your last exercise;come the next sabbath, and i will content you.buckingham:what, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?your friends at pomfret, they do need the priest;your honour hath no shriving work in hand.hastings:good faith, and when i met this holy man,those men you talk of came into my mind.what, go you toward the tower?buckingham:i do, my lord; but long i shall not stayi shall return before your lordship thence.hastings:'tis like enough, for i stay dinner there.buckingham:hastings:i'll wait upon your lordship.ratcliff:come, bring forth the prisoners.rivers:sir richard ratcliff, let me tell thee this:to-day shalt thou behold a subject diefor truth, for duty, and for loyalty.grey:god keep the prince from all the pack of you!a knot you are of damned blood-suckers!vaughan:you live that shall cry woe for this after.ratcliff:dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.rivers:o pomfret, pomfret! o thou bloody prison,fatal and ominous to noble peers!within the guilty closure of thy wallsrichard the second here was hack'd to death;and, for more slander to thy dismal seat,we give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.grey:now margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,for standing by when richard stabb'd her son.rivers:then cursed she hastings, then cursed she buckingham,then cursed she richard. o, remember, godto hear her prayers for them, as now for usand for my sister and her princely sons,be satisfied, dear god, with our true blood,which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.ratcliff:make haste; the hour of death is expiate.rivers:come, grey, come, vaughan, let us all embrace:and take our leave, until we meet in heaven.hastings:my lords, at once: the cause why we are metis, to determine of the coronation.in god's name, speak: when is the royal day?buckingham:are all things fitting for that royal time?derby:it is, and wants but nomination.bishop of ely:to-morrow, then, i judge a happy day.buckingham:who knows the lord protector's mind herein?who is most inward with the royal duke?bishop of ely:your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.buckingham:who, i, my lord i we know each other's faces,but for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,than i of yours;nor i no more of his, than you of mine.lord hastings, you and he are near in love.hastings:i thank his grace, i know he loves me well;but, for his purpose in the coronation.i have not sounded him, nor he deliver'dhis gracious pleasure any way therein:but you, my noble lords, may name the time;and in the duke's behalf i'll give my voice,which, i presume, he'll take in gentle part.bishop of ely:now in good time, here comes the duke himself.gloucester:my noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.i have been long a sleeper; but, i hope,my absence doth neglect no great designs,which by my presence might have been concluded.buckingham:had not you come upon your cue, my lordwilliam lord hastings had pronounced your part,--i mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.gloucester:than my lord hastings no man might be bolder;his lordship knows me well, and loves me well.hastings:i thank your grace.gloucester:my lord of ely!bishop of ely:my lord?gloucester:when i was last in holborn,i saw good strawberries in your garden therei do beseech you send for some of them.bishop of ely:marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.gloucester:cousin of buckingham, a word with you.catesby hath sounded hastings in our business,and finds the testy gentleman so hot,as he will lose his head ere give consenthis master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,shall lose the royalty of england's throne.buckingham:withdraw you hence, my lord, i'll follow you.derby:we have not yet set down this day of triumph.to-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;for i myself am not so well providedas else i would be, were the day prolong'd.bishop of ely:where is my lord protector? i have sent for thesestrawberries.hastings:his grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;there's some conceit or other likes him well,when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.i think there's never a man in christendomthat can less hide his love or hate than he;for by his face straight shall you know his heart.derby:what of his heart perceive you in his faceby any likelihood he show'd to-day?hastings:marry, that with no man here he is offended;for, were he, he had shown it in his looks.derby:i pray god he be not, i say.gloucester:i pray you all, tell me what they deservethat do conspire my death with devilish plotsof damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'dupon my body with their hellish charms?hastings:the tender love i bear your grace, my lord,makes me most forward in this noble presenceto doom the offenders, whatsoever they bei say, my lord, they have deserved death.gloucester:then be your eyes the witness of this ill:see how i am bewitch'd; behold mine armis, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:and this is edward's wife, that monstrous witch,consorted with that harlot strumpet shore,that by their witchcraft thus have marked me.hastings:if they have done this thing, my gracious lord--gloucester:if i thou protector of this damned strumpet--tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  thou art a traitor:off with his head! now, by saint paul i swear,i will not dine until i see the same.lovel and ratcliff, look that it be done:the rest, that love me, rise and follow me.hastings:woe, woe for england! not a whit for me;for i, too fond, might have prevented this.stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;but i disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,and startled, when he look'd upon the tower,as loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.o, now i want the priest that spake to me:i now repent i told the pursuivantas 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,and i myself secure in grace and favour.o margaret, margaret, now thy heavy curseis lighted on poor hastings' wretched head!ratcliff:dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.hastings:o momentary grace of mortal men,which we more hunt for than the grace of god!who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,ready, with every nod, to tumble downinto the fatal bowels of the deep.lovel:come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.hastings:o bloody richard! miserable england!i prophesy the fearful'st time to theethat ever wretched age hath look'd upon.come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.they smile at me that shortly shall be dead.gloucester:come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,murder thy breath in the middle of a word,and then begin again, and stop again,as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?buckingham:tut, i can counterfeit the deep tragedian;speak and look back, and pry on every side,tremble and start at wagging of a straw,intending deep suspicion: ghastly looksare at my service, like enforced smiles;and both are ready in their offices,at any time, to grace my stratagems.but what, is catesby gone?gloucester:he is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.buckingham:lord mayor,--gloucester:look to the drawbridge there!buckingham:hark! a drum.gloucester:catesby, o'erlook the walls.buckingham:lord mayor, the reason we have sent--gloucester:look back, defend thee, here are enemies.buckingham:god and our innocency defend and guard us!gloucester:be patient, they are friends, ratcliff and lovel.lovel:here is the head of that ignoble traitor,the dangerous and unsuspected hastings.gloucester:so dear i loved the man, that i must weep.i took him for the plainest harmless creaturethat breathed upon this earth a christian;made him my book wherein my soul recordedthe history of all her secret thoughts:so smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,that, his apparent open guilt omitted,i mean, his conversation with shore's wife,he lived from all attainder of suspect.buckingham:well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitorthat ever lived.would you imagine, or almost believe,were't not that, by great preservation,we live to tell it you, the subtle traitorthis day had plotted, in the council-houseto murder me and my good lord of gloucester?lord mayor:what, had he so?gloucester:what, think you we are turks or infidels?or that we would, against the form of law,proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,but that the extreme peril of the case,the peace of england and our persons' safety,enforced us to this execution?lord mayor:now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;and you my good lords, both have well proceeded,to warn false traitors from the like attempts.i never look'd for better at his hands,after he once fell in with mistress shore.gloucester:yet had not we determined he should die,until your lordship came to see his death;which now the loving haste of these our friends,somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:because, my lord, we would have had you heardthe traitor speak, and timorously confessthe manner and the purpose of his treason;that you might well have signified the sameunto the citizens, who haply maymisconstrue us in him and wail his death.lord mayor:but, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,as well as i had seen and heard him speakand doubt you not, right noble princes both,but i'll acquaint our duteous citizenswith all your just proceedings in this cause.gloucester:and to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,to avoid the carping censures of the world.buckingham:but since you come too late of our intents,yet witness what you hear we did intend:and so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.gloucester:go, after, after, cousin buckingham.the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post:there, at your meet'st advantage of the time,infer the bastardy of edward's children:tell them how edward put to death a citizen,only for saying he would make his sonheir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,which, by the sign thereof was termed so.moreover, urge his hateful luxuryand bestial appetite in change of lust;which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,even where his lustful eye or savage heart,without control, listed to make his prey.nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:tell them, when that my mother went with childof that unsatiate edward, noble yorkmy princely father then had wars in franceand, by just computation of the time,found that the issue was not his begot;which well appeared in his lineaments,being nothing like the noble duke my father:but touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,because you know, my lord, my mother lives.buckingham:fear not, my lord, i'll play the oratoras if the golden fee for which i pleadwere for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.gloucester:if you thrive well, bring them to baynard's castle;where you shall find me well accompaniedwith reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.buckingham:i go: and towards three or four o'clocklook for the news that the guildhall affords.gloucester:go, lovel, with all speed to doctor shaw;go thou to friar penker; bid them bothmeet me within this hour at baynard's castle.now will i in, to take some privy order,to draw the brats of clarence out of sight;and to give notice, that no manner of personat any time have recourse unto the princes.scrivener:this is the indictment of the good lord hastings;which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,that it may be this day read over in paul's.and mark how well the sequel hangs together:eleven hours i spent to write it over,for yesternight by catesby was it brought me;the precedent was full as long a-doing:and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings,untainted, unexamined, free, at libertyhere's a good world the while! why who's so gross,that seeth not this palpable device?yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?bad is the world; and all will come to nought,when such bad dealings must be seen in thought.gloucester:how now, my lord, what say the citizens?buckingham:now, by the holy mother of our lord,the citizens are mum and speak not a word.gloucester:touch'd you the bastardy of edward's children?buckingham:i did; with his contract with lady lucy,and his contract by deputy in france;the insatiate greediness of his desires,and his enforcement of the city wives;his tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,as being got, your father then in france,his resemblance, being not like the duke;withal i did infer your lineaments,being the right idea of your father,both in your form and nobleness of mind;laid open all your victories in scotland,your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,your bounty, virtue, fair humility:indeed, left nothing fitting for the purposeuntouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourseand when mine oratory grew to an endi bid them that did love their country's goodcry 'god save richard, england's royal king!'gloucester:ah! and did they so?buckingham:no, so god help me, they spake not a word;but, like dumb statues or breathing stones,gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.which when i saw, i reprehended them;and ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:his answer was, the people were not wontto be spoke to but by the recorder.then he was urged to tell my tale again,'thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'but nothing spake in warrant from himself.when he had done, some followers of mine own,at the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,and some ten voices cried 'god save king richard!'and thus i took the vantage of those few,'thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth i;'this general applause and loving shoutargues your wisdoms and your love to richard:'and even here brake off, and came away.gloucester:what tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?buckingham:no, by my troth, my lord.gloucester:will not the mayor then and his brethren come?buckingham:the mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:and look you get a prayer-book in your hand,and stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;for on that ground i'll build a holy descant:and be not easily won to our request:play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.gloucester:i go; and if you plead as well for themas i can say nay to thee for myself,no doubt well bring it to a happy issue.buckingham:go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.welcome my lord; i dance attendance here;i think the duke will not be spoke withal.here comes his servant: how now, catesby,what says he?catesby:my lord: he doth entreat your grace;to visit him to-morrow or next day:he is within, with two right reverend fathers,divinely bent to meditation;and no worldly suit would he be moved,to draw him from his holy exercise.buckingham:return, good catesby, to thy lord again;tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,in deep designs and matters of great moment,no less importing than our general good,are come to have some conference with his grace.catesby:i'll tell him what you say, my lord.buckingham:ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an edward!he is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,but on his knees at meditation;not dallying with a brace of courtezans,but meditating with two deep divines;not sleeping, to engross his idle body,but praying, to enrich his watchful soul:happy were england, would this gracious princetake on himself the sovereignty thereof:but, sure, i fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.lord mayor:marry, god forbid his grace should say us nay!buckingham:i fear he will.how now, catesby, what says your lord?catesby:my lord,he wonders to what end you have assembledsuch troops of citizens to speak with him,his grace not being warn'd thereof before:my lord, he fears you mean no good to him.buckingham:sorry i am my noble cousin shouldsuspect me, that i mean no good to him:by heaven, i come in perfect love to him;and so once more return and tell his grace.when holy and devout religious menare at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,so sweet is zealous contemplation.lord mayor:see, where he stands between two clergymen!buckingham:two props of virtue for a christian prince,to stay him from the fall of vanity:and, see, a book of prayer in his hand,true ornaments to know a holy man.famous plantagenet, most gracious prince,lend favourable ears to our request;and pardon us the interruptionof thy devotion and right christian zeal.gloucester:my lord, there needs no such apology:i rather do beseech you pardon me,who, earnest in the service of my god,neglect the visitation of my friends.but, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?buckingham:even that, i hope, which pleaseth god above,and all good men of this ungovern'd isle.gloucester:i do suspect i have done some offencethat seems disgracious in the city's eyes,and that you come to reprehend my ignorance.buckingham:you have, my lord: would it might please your grace,at our entreaties, to amend that fault!gloucester:else wherefore breathe i in a christian land?buckingham:then know, it is your fault that you resignthe supreme seat, the throne majestical,the scepter'd office of your ancestors,your state of fortune and your due of birth,the lineal glory of your royal house,to the corruption of a blemished stock:whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,which here we waken to our country's good,this noble isle doth want her proper limbs;her face defaced with scars of infamy,her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,and almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulfof blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.which to recure, we heartily solicityour gracious self to take on you the chargeand kingly government of this your land,not as protector, steward, substitute,or lowly factor for another's gain;but as successively from blood to blood,your right of birth, your empery, your own.for this, consorted with the citizens,your very worshipful and loving friends,and by their vehement instigation,in this just suit come i to move your grace.gloucester:i know not whether to depart in silence,or bitterly to speak in your reproof.best fitteth my degree or your conditionif not to answer, you might haply thinktongue-tied ambition, not replying, yieldedto bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,which fondly you would here impose on me;if to reprove you for this suit of yours,so season'd with your faithful love to me.then, on the other side, i cheque'd my friends.therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,and then, in speaking, not to incur the last,definitively thus i answer you.your love deserves my thanks; but my desertunmeritable shuns your high request.first if all obstacles were cut away,and that my path were even to the crown,as my ripe revenue and due by birthyet so much is my poverty of spirit,so mighty and so many my defects,as i had rather hide me from my greatness,being a bark to brook no mighty sea,than in my greatness covet to be hid,and in the vapour of my glory smother'd.but, god be thank'd, there's no need of me,and much i need to help you, if need were;the royal tree hath left us royal fruit,which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,will well become the seat of majesty,and make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.on him i lay what you would lay on me,the right and fortune of his happy stars;which god defend that i should wring from him!buckingham:my lord, this argues conscience in your grace;but the respects thereof are nice and trivial,all circumstances well considered.you say that edward is your brother's son:so say we too, but not by edward's wife;for first he was contract to lady lucy--your mother lives a witness to that vow--and afterward by substitute betroth'dto bona, sister to the king of france.these both put by a poor petitioner,a care-crazed mother of a many children,a beauty-waning and distressed widow,even in the afternoon of her best days,made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughtsto base declension and loathed bigamyby her, in his unlawful bed, he gotthis edward, whom our manners term the prince.more bitterly could i expostulate,save that, for reverence to some alive,i give a sparing limit to my tongue.then, good my lord, take to your royal selfthis proffer'd benefit of dignity;if non to bless us and the land withal,yet to draw forth your noble ancestryfrom the corruption of abusing times,unto a lineal true-derived course.lord mayor:do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.buckingham:refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.catesby:o, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!gloucester:alas, why would you heap these cares on me?i am unfit for state and majesty;i do beseech you, take it not amiss;i cannot nor i will not yield to you.buckingham:if you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,loath to depose the child, your brother's son;as well we know your tenderness of heartand gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,which we have noted in you to your kin,and egally indeed to all estates,--yet whether you accept our suit or no,your brother's son shall never reign our king;but we will plant some other in the throne,to the disgrace and downfall of your house:and in this resolution here we leave you.--come, citizens: 'zounds! i'll entreat no more.gloucester:o, do not swear, my lord of buckingham.catesby:call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.another:do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.gloucester:would you enforce me to a world of care?well, call them again. i am not made of stone,but penetrable to your. kind entreats,albeit against my conscience and my soul.cousin of buckingham, and you sage, grave men,since you will buckle fortune on my back,to bear her burthen, whether i will or no,i must have patience to endure the load:but if black scandal or foul-faced reproachattend the sequel of your imposition,your mere enforcement shall acquittance mefrom all the impure blots and stains thereof;for god he knows, and you may partly see,how far i am from the desire thereof.lord mayor:god bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.gloucester:in saying so, you shall but say the truth.buckingham:then i salute you with this kingly title:long live richard, england's royal king!lord mayor:amen.buckingham:to-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?gloucester:even when you please, since you will have it so.buckingham:to-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:and so most joyfully we take our leave.gloucester:come, let us to our holy task again.farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.duchess of york:who meets us here?  my niece plantagenetled in the hand of her kind aunt of gloucester?now, for my life, she's wandering to the tower,on pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.daughter, well met.lady anne:god give your graces botha happy and a joyful time of day!queen elizabeth:as much to you, good sister! whither away?lady anne:no farther than the tower;

'tis so: but edward lives.buckingham:true, noble prince.king richard iii:o bitter consequence,that edward still should live! 'true, noble prince!'cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:shall i be plain? i wish the bastards dead;and i would have it suddenly perform'd.what sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.buckingham:your grace may do your pleasure.king richard iii:tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:say, have i thy consent that they shall die?buckingham:give me some breath, some little pause, my lordbefore i positively herein:i will resolve your grace immediately.catesby:king richard iii:i will converse with iron-witted foolsand unrespective boys: none are for methat look

should possess.king richard iii:stanley, look to your wife; if she conveyletters to richmond, you shall answer it.buckingham:what says your highness to my just demand?king richard iii:as i remember, henry the sixthdid prophesy that richmond should be king,when richmond was a little peevish boy.a king, perhaps, perhaps,--buckingham:my lord!king richard iii:how chance the prophet could not at that timehave told me, i being by, that i should kill him?buckingham:my lord, your promise for the earldom,--king richard iii:richmond! when last i was at exeter,the mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,and call'd it rougemont: at which name i started,because a bard of ireland told me oncei should not live long after i saw richmond.buckingham:my lord!king richard iii:ay, what's o'clock?buckingham:i am thus bold to put your grace in mindof what you promised me.king richard iii:well, but what's o'clock?buckingham:upon the stroke of ten.king richard iii:well, let it strike.buckingham:why let it strike?king richard iii:because that, like a jack, thou keep'st the strokebetwixt thy begging and my meditation.i am not in the giving vein to-day.buckingham:why, then resolve me whether you will or no.king richard iii:tut, tut,thou troublest me; am not in the vein.buckingham:is it even so? rewards he my true servicewith such deep contempt made i him king for this?o, let me think on hastings, and be goneto brecknock, while my fearful head is on!tyrrel:the tyrannous and bloody deed is done.the most arch of piteous massacrethat ever yet this land was guilty of.dighton and forrest, whom i did subornto do this ruthless piece of butchery,although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,melting with tenderness and kind compassionwept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.'lo, thus' quoth dighton, 'lay those tender babes:''thus, thus,' quoth forrest, 'girdling one anotherwithin their innocent alabaster arms:their lips were four red roses on a stalk,which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.a book of prayers on their pillow lay;which once,' quoth forrest, 'almost changed my mind;but o! the devil'--there the villain stopp'dwhilst dighton thus told on: 'we smotheredthe most replenished sweet work of nature,that from the prime creation e'er she framed.'thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;they could not speak; and so i left them both,to bring this tidings to the bloody king.and here he comes.all hail, my sovereign liege!king richard iii:kind tyrrel, am i happy in thy news?tyrrel:if to have done the thing you gave in chargebeget your happiness, be happy then,for it is done, my lord.king richard iii:but didst thou see them dead?tyrrel:i did, my lord.king richard iii:and buried, gentle tyrrel?tyrrel:the chaplain of the tower hath buried them;but how or in what place i do not know.king richard iii:come to me, tyrrel, soon at after supper,and thou shalt tell the process of their death.meantime, but think how i may do thee good,and be inheritor of thy desire.farewell till soon.the son of clarence have i pent up close;his daughter meanly have i match'd in marriage;the sons of edward sleep in abraham's bosom,and anne my wife hath bid the world good night.now, for i know the breton richmond aimsat young elizabeth, my brother's daughter,and, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,to her i go, a jolly thriving wooer.catesby:my lord!king richard iii:good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?catesby:bad news, my lord: ely is fled to richmond;and buckingham, back'd with the hardy welshmen,is in the field, and still his power increaseth.king richard iii:ely with richmond troubles me more nearthan buckingham and his rash-levied army.come, i have heard that fearful commentingis leaden servitor to dull delay;delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggarythen fiery expedition be my wing,jove's mercury, and herald for a king!come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;we must be brief when traitors brave the field.queen margaret:so, now prosperity begins to mellowand drop into the rotten mouth of death.here in these confines slily have i lurk'd,to watch the waning of mine adversaries.a dire induction am i witness to,and will to france, hoping the consequencewill prove as bitter, black, and tragical.withdraw thee, wretched margaret: who comes here?queen elizabeth:ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!my unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!if yet your gentle souls fly in the airand be not fix'd in doom perpetual,hover about me with your airy wingsand hear your mother's lamentation!queen margaret:hover about her; say, that right for righthath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.duchess of york:so many miseries have crazed my voice,that my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,edward plantagenet, why art thou dead?queen margaret:plantagenet doth quit plantagenet.edward for edward pays a dying debt.queen elizabeth:wilt thou, o god, fly from such gentle lambs,and throw them in the entrails of the wolf?when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?queen margaret:when holy harry died, and my sweet son.duchess of york:blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,brief abstract and record of tedious days,rest thy unrest on england's lawful earth,unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!queen elizabeth:o, that thou wouldst as well afford a graveas thou canst yield a melancholy seat!then would i hide my bones, not rest them here.o, who hath any cause to mourn but i?queen margaret:if ancient sorrow be most reverend,give mine the benefit of seniory,and let my woes frown on the upper hand.if sorrow can admit society,tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:i had an edward, till a richard kill'd him;i had a harry, till a richard kill'd him:thou hadst an edward, till a richard kill'd him;thou hadst a richard, till a richard killed him;duchess of york:i had a richard too, and thou didst kill him;i had a rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.queen margaret:thou hadst a clarence too, and richard kill'd him.from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crepta hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:that dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,that foul defacer of god's handiwork,that excellent grand tyrant of the earth,that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.o upright, just, and true-disposing god,how do i thank thee, that this carnal curpreys on the issue of his mother's body,and makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!duchess of york:o harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!god witness with me, i have wept for thine.queen margaret:bear with me; i am hungry for revenge,and now i cloy me with beholding it.thy edward he is dead, that stabb'd my edward:thy other edward dead, to quit my edward;young york he is but boot, because both theymatch not the high perfection of my loss:thy clarence he is dead that kill'd my edward;and the beholders of this tragic play,the adulterate hastings, rivers, vaughan, grey,untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,only reserved their factor, to buy soulsand send them thither: but at hand, at hand,ensues his piteous and unpitied end:earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.to have him suddenly convey'd away.cancel his bond of life, dear god, i prey,that i may live to say, the dog is dead!queen elizabeth:o, thou didst prophesy the time would comethat i should wish for thee to help me cursethat bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!queen margaret:i call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;i call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;the presentation of but what i was;the flattering index of a direful pageant;one heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;a mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;a dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,a sign of dignity, a garish flag,to be the aim of every dangerous shot,a queen in jest, only to fill the scene.where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?who sues to thee and cries 'god save the queen'?where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?decline all this, and see what now thou art:for happy wife, a most distressed widow;for joyful mother, one that wails the name;for queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;for one being sued to, one that humbly sues;for one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;for one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;for one commanding all, obey'd of none.thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,and left thee but a very prey to time;having no more but thought of what thou wert,to torture thee the more, being what thou art.thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou notusurp the just proportion of my sorrow?now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;from which even here i slip my weary neck,and leave the burthen of it all on thee.farewell, york's wife, and queen of sad mischance:these english woes will make me smile in france.queen elizabeth:o thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,and teach me how to curse mine enemies!queen margaret:forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;compare dead happiness with living woe;think that thy babes were fairer than they were,and he that slew them fouler than he is:bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:revolving this will teach thee how to curse.queen elizabeth:my words are dull; o, quicken them with thine!queen margaret:thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.duchess of york:why should calamity be full of words?queen elizabeth:windy attorneys to their client woes,airy succeeders of intestate joys,poor breathing orators of miseries!let them have scope: though what they do imparthelp not all, yet do they ease the heart.duchess of york:if so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.and in the breath of bitter words let's smothermy damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.i hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.king richard iii:who intercepts my expedition?duchess of york:o, she that might have intercepted thee,by strangling thee in her accursed wombfrom all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!queen elizabeth:hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,where should be graven, if that right were right,the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,and the dire death of my two sons and brothers?tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?duchess of york:thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother clarence?and little ned plantagenet, his son?queen elizabeth:where is kind hastings, rivers, vaughan, grey?king richard iii:a flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!let not the heavens hear these tell-tale womenrail on the lord's enointed: strike, i say!either be patient, and entreat me fair,or with the clamorous report of warthus will i drown your exclamations.duchess of york:art thou my son?king richard iii:ay, i thank god, my father, and yourself.duchess of york:then patiently hear my impatience.king richard iii:madam, i have a touch of your condition,which cannot brook the accent of reproof.duchess of york:o, let me speak!king richard iii:do then: but i'll not hear.duchess of york:i will be mild and gentle in my speech.king richard iii:and brief, good mother; for i am in haste.duchess of york:art thou so hasty? i have stay'd for thee,god knows, in anguish, pain and agony.king richard iii:and came i not at last to comfort you?duchess of york:no, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.a grievous burthen was thy birth to me;tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,treacherous,more mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:what comfortable hour canst thou name,that ever graced me in thy company?king richard iii:faith, none, but humphrey hour, that call'dyour graceto breakfast once forth of my company.if i be so disgracious in your sight,let me march on, and not offend your grace.strike the drum.duchess of york:i prithee, hear me speak.king richard iii:you speak too bitterly.duchess of york:hear me a word;for i shall never speak to thee again.king richard iii:so.duchess of york:either thou wilt die, by god's just ordinance,ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,or i with grief and extreme age shall perishand never look upon thy face again.therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;which, in the day of battle, tire thee morethan all the complete armour that thou wear'st!my prayers on the adverse party fight;and there the little souls of edward's childrenwhisper the spirits of thine enemiesand promise them success and victory.bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.queen elizabeth:though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curseabides in me; i say amen to all.king richard iii:stay, madam; i must speak a word with you.queen elizabeth:i have no more sons of the royal bloodfor thee to murder: for my daughters, richard,they shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;and therefore level not to hit their lives.king richard iii:you have a daughter call'd elizabeth,virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.queen elizabeth:and must she die for this? o, let her live,and i'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;slander myself as false to edward's bed;throw over her the veil of infamy:so she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,i will confess she was not edward's daughter.king richard iii:wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.queen elizabeth:to save her life, i'll say she is not so.king richard iii:her life is only safest in her birth.queen elizabeth:and only in that safety died her brothers.king richard iii:lo, at their births good stars were opposite.queen elizabeth:no, to their lives bad friends were contrary.king richard iii:all unavoided is the doom of destiny.queen elizabeth:true, when avoided grace makes destiny:my babes were destined to a fairer death,if grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.king richard iii:you speak as if that i had slain my cousins.queen elizabeth:cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'dof comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunttill it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,to revel in the entrails of my lambs.but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,my tongue should to thy ears not name my boystill that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;and i, in such a desperate bay of death,like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.king richard iii:madam, so thrive i in my enterpriseand dangerous success of bloody wars,as i intend more good to you and yours,than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!queen elizabeth:what good is cover'd with the face of heaven,to be discover'd, that can do me good?king richard iii:the advancement of your children, gentle lady.queen elizabeth:up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?king richard iii:no, to the dignity and height of honourthe high imperial type of this earth's glory.queen elizabeth:flatter my sorrows with report of it;tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,canst thou demise to any child of mine?king richard iii:even all i have; yea, and myself and all,will i withal endow a child of thine;so in the lethe of thy angry soulthou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongswhich thou supposest i have done to thee.queen elizabeth:be brief, lest that be process of thy kindnesslast longer telling than thy kindness' date.king richard iii:then know, that from my soul i love thy daughter.queen elizabeth:my daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.king richard iii:what do you think?queen elizabeth:that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:so from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;and from my heart's love i do thank thee for it.king richard iii:be not so hasty to confound my meaning:i mean, that with my soul i love thy daughter,and mean to make her queen of england.queen elizabeth:say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?king richard iii:even he that makes her queen who should be else?queen elizabeth:what, thou?king richard iii:i, even i: what think you of it, madam?queen elizabeth:how canst thou woo her?king richard iii:that would i learn of you,as one that are best acquainted with her humour.queen elizabeth:and wilt thou learn of me?king richard iii:madam, with all my heart.queen elizabeth:send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,a pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engraveedward and york; then haply she will weep:therefore present to her--as sometime margaretdid to thy father, steep'd in rutland's blood,--a handkerchief; which, say to her, did drainthe purple sap from her sweet brother's bodyand bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.if this inducement force her not to love,send her a story of thy noble acts;tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence,her uncle rivers; yea, and, for her sake,madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne.king richard iii:come, come, you mock me; this is not the wayto win our daughter.queen elizabeth:there is no other wayunless thou couldst put on some other shape,and not be richard that hath done all this.king richard iii:say that i did all this for love of her.queen elizabeth:nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,having bought love with such a bloody spoil.king richard iii:look, what is done cannot be now amended:men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,which after hours give leisure to repent.if i did take the kingdom from your sons,to make amends, ill give it to your daughter.if i have kill'd the issue of your womb,to quicken your increase, i will begetmine issue of your blood upon your daughtera grandam's name is little less in lovethan is the doting title of a mother;they are as children but one step below,even of your mettle, of your very blood;of an one pain, save for a night of groansendured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.your children were vexation to your youth,but mine shall be a comfort to your age.the loss you have is but a son being king,and by that loss your daughter is made queen.i cannot make you what amends i would,therefore accept such kindness as i can.dorset your son, that with a fearful soulleads discontented steps in foreign soil,this fair alliance quickly shall call hometo high promotions and great dignity:the king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.familiarly shall call thy dorset brother;again shall you be mother to a king,and all the ruins of distressful timesrepair'd with double riches of content.what! we have many goodly days to see:the liquid drops of tears that you have shedshall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,advantaging their loan with interestof ten times double gain of happiness.go, then my mother, to thy daughter gomake bold her bashful years with your experience;prepare her ears to hear a wooer's taleput in her tender heart the aspiring flameof golden sovereignty; acquaint the princesswith the sweet silent hours of marriage joysand when this arm of mine hath chastisedthe petty rebel, dull-brain'd buckingham,bound with triumphant garlands will i comeand lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;to whom i will retail my conquest won,and she shall be sole victress, caesar's caesar.queen elizabeth:what were i best to say? her father's brotherwould be her lord? or shall i say, her uncle?or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?under what title shall i woo for thee,that god, the law, my honour and her love,can make seem pleasing to her tender years?king richard iii:infer fair england's peace by this alliance.queen elizabeth:which she shall purchase with still lasting war.king richard iii:say that the king, which may command, entreats.queen elizabeth:that at her hands which the king's king forbids.king richard iii:say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.queen elizabeth:to wail the tide, as her mother doth.king richard iii:say, i will love her everlastingly.queen elizabeth:but how long shall that title 'ever' last?king richard iii:sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.queen elizabeth:but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?king richard iii:so long as heaven and nature lengthens it.queen elizabeth:so long as hell and richard likes of it.king richard iii:say, i, her sovereign, am her subject love.queen elizabeth:but she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.king richard iii:be eloquent in my behalf to her.queen elizabeth:an honest tale speeds best being plainly told.king richard iii:then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.queen elizabeth:plain and not honest is too harsh a style.king richard iii:your reasons are too shallow and too quick.queen elizabeth:o no, my reasons are too deep and dead;too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.king richard iii:harp not on that string, madam; that is past.queen elizabeth:harp on it still shall i till heart-strings break.king richard iii:now, by my george, my garter, and my crown,--queen elizabeth:profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.king richard iii:i swear--queen elizabeth:by nothing; for this is no oath:the george, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;the garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;the crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.if something thou wilt swear to be believed,swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.king richard iii:now, by the world--queen elizabeth:'tis full of thy foul wrongs.king richard iii:my father's death--queen elizabeth:thy life hath that dishonour'd.king richard iii:then, by myself--queen elizabeth:thyself thyself misusest.king richard iii:why then, by god--queen elizabeth:god's wrong is most of all.if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him,the unity the king thy brother madehad not been broken, nor my brother slain:if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him,the imperial metal, circling now thy brow,had graced the tender temples of my child,and both the princes had been breathing here,which now, two tender playfellows to dust,thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.what canst thou swear by now?king richard iii:the time to come.queen elizabeth:that thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;for i myself have many tears to washhereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.the children live, whose parents thou hastslaughter'd,ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;the parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.swear not by time to come; for that thou hastmisused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.king richard iii:as i intend to prosper and repent,so thrive i in my dangerous attemptof hostile arms! myself myself confound!heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!be opposite all planets of good luckto my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!in her consists my happiness and thine;without her, follows to this land and me,to thee, herself, and many a christian soul,death, desolation, ruin and decay:it cannot be avoided but by this;it will not be avoided but by this.therefore, good mother,--i must can you so--be the attorney of my love to her:plead what i will be, not what i have been;not my deserts, but what i will deserve:urge the necessity and state of times,and be not peevish-fond in great designs.queen elizabeth:shall i be tempted of the devil thus?king richard iii:ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.queen elizabeth:shall i forget myself to be myself?king richard iii:ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.queen elizabeth:but thou didst kill my children.king richard iii:but in your daughter's womb i bury them:where in that nest of spicery they shall breedselves of themselves, to your recomforture.queen elizabeth:shall i go win my daughter to thy will?king richard iii:and be a happy mother by the deed.queen elizabeth:i go. write to me very shortly.and you shall understand from me her mind.king richard iii:bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!how now! what news?ratcliff:my gracious sovereign, on the western coastrideth a puissant navy; to the shorethrong many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:'tis thought that richmond is their admiral;and there they hull, expecting but the aidof buckingham to welcome them ashore.king richard iii:some light-foot friend post to the duke of norfolk:ratcliff, thyself, or catesby; where is he?catesby:here, my lord.king richard iii:fly to the duke:post thou to salisburywhen thou comest thither--dull, unmindful villain,why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?catesby:first, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,what from your grace i shall deliver to him.king richard iii:o, true, good catesby: bid him levy straightthe greatest strength and power he can make,and meet me presently at salisbury.catesby:i go.ratcliff:what is't your highness' pleasure i shall do atsalisbury?king richard iii:why, what wouldst thou do there before i go?ratcliff:your highness told me i should post before.king richard iii:my mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.how now, what news with you?stanley:none good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;nor none so bad, but it may well be told.king richard iii:hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!why dost thou run so many mile about,when thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?once more, what news?stanley:richmond is on the seas.king richard iii:there let him sink, and be the seas on him!white-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?stanley:i know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.king richard iii:well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?stanley:stirr'd up by dorset, buckingham, and ely,he makes for england, there to claim the crown.king richard iii:is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?what heir of york is there alive but we?and who is england's king but great york's heir?then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?stanley:unless for that, my liege, i cannot guess.king richard iii:unless for that he comes to be your liege,you cannot guess wherefore the welshman comes.thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, i fear.stanley:no, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.king richard iii:where is thy power, then, to beat him back?where are thy tenants and thy followers?are they not now upon the western shore.safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!stanley:no, my good lord, my friends are in the north.king richard iii:cold friends to richard: what do they in the north,when they should serve their sovereign in the west?stanley:they have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:please it your majesty to give me leave,i'll muster up my friends, and meet your gracewhere and what time your majesty shall please.king richard iii:ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with richmond:i will not trust you, sir.stanley:most mighty sovereign,you have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:i never was nor never will be false.king richard iii:well,go muster men; but, hear you, leave behindyour son, george stanley: look your faith be firm.or else his head's assurance is but frail.stanley:so deal with him as i prove true to you.messenger:my gracious sovereign, now in devonshire,as i by friends am well advertised,sir edward courtney, and the haughty prelatebishop of exeter, his brother there,with many more confederates, are in arms.second messenger:my liege, in kent the guildfords are in arms;and every hour more competitorsflock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.third messenger:my lord, the army of the duke of buckingham--king richard iii:out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?take that, until thou bring me better news.third messenger:the news i have to tell your majestyis, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;and he himself wander'd away alone,no man knows whither.king richard iii:i cry thee mercy:there is my purse to cure that blow of thine.hath any well-advised friend proclaim'dreward to him that brings the traitor in?third messenger:such proclamation hath been made, my liege.fourth messenger:sir thomas lovel and lord marquis dorset,'tis said, my liege, in yorkshire are in arms.yet this good comfort bring i to your grace,the breton navy is dispersed by tempest:richmond, in yorkshire, sent out a boatunto the shore, to ask those on the banksif they were his assistants, yea or no;who answer'd him, they came from buckingham.upon his party: he, mistrusting them,hoisted sail and made away for brittany.king richard iii:march on, march on, since we are up in arms;if not to fight with foreign enemies,yet to beat down these rebels here at home.catesby:my liege, the duke of buckingham is taken;that is the best news: that the earl of richmondis with a mighty power landed at milford,is colder tidings, yet they must be told.king richard iii:away towards salisbury! while we reason here,a royal battle might be won and lostsome one take order buckingham be broughtto salisbury; the rest march on with me.derby:sir christopher, tell richmond this from me:that in the sty of this most bloody boarmy son george stanley is frank'd up in hold:if i revolt, off goes young george's head;the fear of that withholds my present aid.but, tell me, where is princely richmond now?christopher:at pembroke, or at harford-west, in wales.derby:what men of name resort to him?christopher:sir walter herbert, a renowned soldier;sir gilbert talbot, sir william stanley;oxford, redoubted pembroke, sir james blunt,and rice ap thomas with a valiant crew;and many more of noble fame and worth:and towards london they do bend their course,if by the way they

destruction!this is all-souls' day, fellows, is it not?sheriff:it is, my lord.buckingham:why, then all-souls' day is my body's doomsday.this is the day that, in king edward's time,i wish't might fall on me, when i was foundfalse to his children or his wife's alliesthis is the day wherein i wish'd to fallby the false faith of him i trusted most;this, this all-souls' day to my fearful soulis the determined respite of my wrongs:that high all-seer that i dallied withhath turn'd my feigned prayer on my headand given in earnest what i begg'd in jest.thus doth he force the swords of wicked mento turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:now margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;'when he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,remember margaret was a prophetess.'come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.richmond:fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,thus far into the bowels of the landhave we march'd on without impediment;and here receive we from our father stanleylines of fair comfort and encouragement.the wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,that spoil'd your summer fields

learnfrom tamworth thither is but one day's march.in god's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,to reap the harvest of perpetual peaceby this one bloody trial of sharp war.oxford:every man's conscience is a thousand swords,to fight against that bloody homicide.herbert:i doubt not but his friends will fly to us.blunt:he hath no friends but who are friends for fear.which in his greatest need will shrink from him.richmond:all for our vantage. then, in god's name, march:true hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.king richard iii:here pitch our tents, even here in bosworth field.my lord of surrey, why look you so sad?surrey:my heart is ten times lighter than my looks.king richard iii:my lord of norfolk,--norfolk:here, most gracious liege.king richard iii:norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?norfolk:we must both give and take, my gracious lord.king richard iii:up with my tent there! here will i lie tonight;but where to-morrow?  well, all's one for that.who hath descried the number of the foe?norfolk:six or seven thousand is their utmost power.king richard iii:why, our battalion trebles that account:besides,

second hour in the morningdesire the earl to see me in my tent:yet one thing more, good blunt, before thou go'st,where is lord stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?blunt:unless i have mista'en his colours much,which well i am assured i have not done,his regiment lies half a mile at leastsouth from the mighty power of the king.richmond:if without peril it be possible,good captain blunt, bear my good-night to him,and give him from me this most needful scroll.blunt:upon my life, my lord, i'll under-take it;and so, god give you quiet rest to-night!richmond:good night, good captain blunt. come gentlemen,let us consult upon to-morrow's businessin to our tent; the air is raw and cold.king richard iii:what is't o'clock?catesby:it's supper-time, my lord;it's nine o'clock.king richard iii:i will

melancholy lord northumberland?ratcliff:thomas the earl of surrey, and himself,much about cock-shut time, from troop to troopwent through the army, cheering up the soldiers.king richard iii:so, i am satisfied. give me a bowl of wine:i have not that alacrity of spirit,nor cheer of mind, that i was wont to have.set it down. is ink and paper ready?ratcliff:it is, my lord.king richard iii:bid my

hours steal on,and flaky darkness breaks within the east.in brief,--for so the season bids us be,--prepare thy battle early in the morning,and put thy fortune to the arbitrementof bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.i, as i may--that which i would i cannot,--with best advantage will deceive the time,and aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:but on thy side i may not be too forwardlest, being seen, thy brother, tender george,be executed in his father's sight.farewell: the leisure and the fearful timecuts off the ceremonious vows of loveand ample interchange of sweet discourse,which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:god give us leisure for these rites of love!once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!richmond:good lords, conduct him to his regiment:i'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,when i should mount with wings of victory:once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.o thou, whose captain i account

villain.perjury, perjury, in the high'st degreemurder, stem murder, in the direst degree;all several sins, all used in each degree,throng to the bar, crying all, guilty! guilty!i shall despair. there is no creature loves me;and if i die, no soul shall pity me:nay, wherefore should they, since that i myselffind in myself no pity to myself?methought the souls of all that i had murder'dcame to my tent; and every one did threatto-morrow's vengeance on the head of richard.ratcliff:my lord!king richard iii:'zounds! who is there?ratcliff:ratcliff, my lord; 'tis i. the early village-cockhath twice done salutation to the morn;your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.king richard iii:o ratcliff, i have dream'd a fearful dream!what thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?ratcliff:no doubt, my lord.king richard iii:o ratcliff, i fear, i fear,--ratcliff:nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.king richard iii:by the apostle paul, shadows to-nighthave struck more terror to the soul of richardthan can the substance of ten thousand soldiersarmed in proof, and led by shallow richmond.it is not yet near day. come, go with me;under our tents i'll play the eaves-dropper,to see if any mean to shrink from me.lords:good morrow, richmond!richmond:cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.lords:how have you slept, my lord?richmond:the sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreamsthat ever enter'd in a drowsy head,have i since your departure had, my lords.methought their souls, whose bodies richard murder'd,came to my tent, and cried on victory:i promise you, my soul is very jocundin the remembrance of so fair a dream.how far into the morning is it, lords?lords:upon the stroke of four.richmond:why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.more than i have said, loving countrymen,the leisure and enforcement of the timeforbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,god and our good cause fight upon our side;the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;richard except, those whom we fight againsthad rather have us win than him they follow:for what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,a bloody tyrant and a homicide;one raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;one that made means to come by what he hath,and slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;abase foul stone, made precious by the foilof england's chair, where he is falsely set;one that hath ever been god's enemy:then, if you fight against god's enemy,god will in justice ward you as his soldiers;if you do sweat to put a tyrant down,you sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;if you do fight against your country's foes,your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;if you do fight in safeguard of your wives,your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;if you do free your children from the sword,your children's children quit it in your age.then, in the name of god and all these rights,advance your standards, draw your willing swords.for me, the ransom of my bold attemptshall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;but if i thrive, the gain of my attemptthe least of you shall share his part thereof.sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;god and saint george! richmond and victory!king richard iii:what said northumberland as touching richmond?ratcliff:that he was never trained up in arms.king richard iii:he said the truth: and what said surrey then?ratcliff:he smiled and said 'the better for our purpose.'king richard iii:he was in the right; and so indeed it is.ten the clock there. give me a calendar.who saw the sun to-day?ratcliff:not i, my lord.king richard iii:then he disdains to shine; for by the bookhe should have braved the east an hour agoa black day will it be to somebody. ratcliff!ratcliff:my lord?king richard iii:the sun will not be seen to-day;the sky doth frown and lour upon our army.i would these dewy tears were from the ground.not shine to-day! why, what is that to memore than to richmond?  for the selfsame heaventhat frowns on me looks sadly upon him.norfolk:arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.king richard iii:come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.call up lord stanley, bid him bring his power:i will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,and thus my battle shall be ordered:my foreward shall be drawn out all in length,consisting equally of horse and foot;our archers shall be placed in the midstjohn duke of norfolk, thomas earl of surrey,shall have the leading of this foot and horse.they thus directed, we will followin the main battle, whose puissance on either sideshall be well winged with our chiefest horse.this, and saint george to boot! what think'st thou, norfolk?norfolk:a good direction, warlike sovereign.this found i on my tent this morning.king richard iii:messenger:my lord, he doth deny to come.king richard iii:off with his son george's head!norfolk:my lord, the enemy is past the marshafter the battle let george stanley die.king richard iii:a thousand hearts are great within my bosom:advance our standards, set upon our foesour ancient word of courage, fair saint george,inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!upon them! victory sits on our helms.catesby:rescue, my lord of norfolk, rescue, rescue!the king enacts more wonders than a man,daring an opposite to every danger:his horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,seeking for richmond in the throat of death.rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!king richard iii:a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!catesby:withdraw, my lord; i'll help you to a horse.king richard iii:slave, i have set my life upon a cast,and i will stand the hazard of the die:i think there be six richmonds in the field;five have i slain to-day instead of him.a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!richmond:god and your arms be praised, victorious friends,the day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.derby:courageous richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.lo, here, this long-usurped royaltyfrom the dead temples of this bloody wretchhave i pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.richmond:great god of heaven, say amen to all!but, tell me, is young george stanley living?derby:he is, my lord, and safe in leicester town;whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.richmond:what men of name are slain on either side?derby:john duke of norfolk, walter lord ferrers,sir robert brakenbury, and sir william brandon.richmond:inter their bodies as becomes their births:proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fledthat in submission will return to us:and then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,we will unite the white rose and the red:smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,that long have frown'd upon their enmity!what traitor hears me, and says not amen?england hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;the brother blindly shed the brother's blood,the father rashly slaughter'd his own son,the son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:all this divided york and lancaster,divided in their dire division,o, now, let richmond and elizabeth,the true succeeders of each royal house,by god's fair ordinance conjoin together!and let their heirs, god, if thy will be so.enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!abate the edge of traitors, gracious lord,that would reduce these bloody days again,and make poor england weep in streams of blood!let them not live to taste this land's increasethat would with treason wound this fair land's peace!now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:that she may long live here, god say amen!king richard ii:old john of gaunt, time-honour'd lancaster,hast thou, according to thy oath and band,brought hither henry hereford thy bold son,here to make good the boisterous late appeal,which then our leisure would not let us hear,against the duke of norfolk, thomas mowbray?john of gaunt:i have, my liege.king richard ii:tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,if he appeal the duke on ancient malice;or worthily, as a good subject should,on some known ground of treachery in him?john of gaunt:as near as i could sift him on that argument,on some apparent danger seen in himaim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.king richard ii:then call them to our presence; face to face,and frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hearthe accuser and the accused freely speak:high-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,in rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.henry bolingbroke:many years of happy days befalmy gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!thomas mowbray:each day still better other's happiness;until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,add an immortal title to your crown!king richard ii:we thank you both: yet one but flatters us,as well appeareth by the cause you come;namely to appeal each other of high treason.cousin of hereford, what dost thou objectagainst the duke of norfolk, thomas mowbray?henry bolingbroke:first, heaven be the record to my speech!in the devotion of a subject's love,tendering the precious safety of my prince,and free from other misbegotten hate,come i appellant to this princely presence.now, thomas mowbray, do i turn to thee,and mark my greeting well; for what i speakmy body shall make good upon this earth,or my divine soul answer it in heaven.thou art a traitor and a miscreant,too good to be so and too bad to live,since the more fair and crystal is the sky,the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.once more, the more to aggravate the note,with a foul traitor's name stuff i thy throat;and wish, so please my sovereign, ere i move,what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.thomas mowbray:let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:'tis not the trial of a woman's war,the bitter clamour of two eager tongues,can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;the blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:yet can i not of such tame patience boastas to be hush'd and nought at all to say:first, the fair reverence of your highness curbs mefrom giving reins and spurs to my free speech;which else would post until it had return'dthese terms of treason doubled down his throat.setting aside his high blood's royalty,and let him be no kinsman to my liege,i do defy him, and i spit at him;call him a slanderous coward and a villain:which to maintain i would allow him odds,and meet him, were i tied to run afooteven to the frozen ridges of the alps,or any other ground inhabitable,where ever englishman durst set his foot.mean time let this defend my loyalty,by all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.henry bolingbroke:pale trembling coward, there i throw my gage,disclaiming here the kindred of the king,and lay aside my high blood's royalty,which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.if guilty dread have left thee so much strengthas to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:by that and all the rites of knighthood else,will i make good against thee, arm to arm,what i have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.thomas mowbray:i take it up; and by that sword i swearwhich gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,i'll answer thee in any fair degree,or chivalrous design of knightly trial:and when i mount, alive may i not light,if i be traitor or unjustly fight!king richard ii:what doth our cousin lay to mowbray's charge?it must be great that can inherit usso much as of a thought of ill in him.henry bolingbroke:look, what i speak, my life shall prove it true;that mowbray hath received eight thousand noblesin name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,the which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,like a false traitor and injurious villain.besides i say and will in battle prove,or here or elsewhere to the furthest vergethat ever was survey'd by english eye,that all the treasons for these eighteen yearscomplotted and contrived in this landfetch from false mowbray their first head and spring.further i say and further will maintainupon his bad life to make all this good,that he did plot the duke of gloucester's death,suggest his soon-believing adversaries,and consequently, like a traitor coward,sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:which blood, like sacrificing abel's, cries,even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,to me for justice and rough chastisement;and, by the glorious worth of my descent,this arm shall do it, or this life be spent.king richard ii:how high a pitch his resolution soars!thomas of norfolk, what say'st thou to this?thomas mowbray:o, let my sovereign turn away his faceand bid his ears a little while be deaf,till i have told this slander of his blood,how god and good men hate so foul a liar.king richard ii:mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,as he is but my father's brother's son,now, by my sceptre's awe, i make a vow,such neighbour nearness to our sacred bloodshould nothing privilege him, nor partializethe unstooping firmness of my upright soul:he is our subject, mowbray; so art thou:free speech and fearless i to thee allow.thomas mowbray:then, bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.three parts of that receipt i had for calaisdisbursed i duly to his highness' soldiers;the other part reserved i by consent,for that my sovereign liege was in my debtupon remainder of a dear account,since last i went to france to fetch his queen:now swallow down that lie. for gloucester's death,i slew him not; but to my own disgraceneglected my sworn duty in that case.for you, my noble lord of lancaster,the honourable father to my foeonce did i lay an ambush for your life,a trespass that doth vex my grieved soulbut ere i last received the sacramenti did confess it, and exactly begg'dyour grace's pardon, and i hope i had it.this is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,it issues from the rancour of a villain,a recreant and most degenerate traitorwhich in myself i boldly will defend;and interchangeably hurl down my gageupon this overweening traitor's foot,to prove myself a loyal gentlemaneven in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.in haste whereof, most heartily i prayyour highness to assign our trial day.king richard ii:wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;let's purge this choler without letting blood:this we prescribe, though no physician;deep malice makes too deep incision;forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;our doctors say this is no month to bleed.good uncle, let this end where it begun;we'll calm the duke of norfolk, you your son.john of gaunt:to be a make-peace shall become my age:throw down, my son, the duke of norfolk's gage.king richard ii:and, norfolk, throw down his.john of gaunt:when, harry, when?obedience bids i should not bid again.king richard ii:norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.thomas mowbray:myself i throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.my life thou shalt command, but not my shame:the one my duty owes; but my fair name,despite of death that lives upon my grave,to dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.i am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,the which no balm can cure but his heart-bloodwhich breathed this poison.king richard ii:rage must be withstood:give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.thomas mowbray:yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.and i resign my gage. my dear dear lord,the purest treasure mortal times affordis spotless reputation: that away,men are but gilded loam or painted clay.a jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chestis a bold spirit in a loyal breast.mine honour is my life; both grow in one:take honour from me, and my life is done:then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;in that i live and for that will i die.king richard ii:cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.henry bolingbroke:o, god defend my soul from such deep sin!shall i seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?or with pale beggar-fear impeach my heightbefore this out-dared dastard? ere my tongueshall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tearthe slavish motive of recanting fear,and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,where shame doth harbour, even in mowbray's face.king richard ii:we were not born to sue, but to command;which since we cannot do to make you friends,be ready, as your lives shall answer it,at coventry, upon saint lambert's day:there shall your swords and lances arbitratethe swelling difference of your settled hate:since we can not atone you, we shall seejustice design the victor's chivalry.lord marshal, command our officers at armsbe ready to direct these home alarms.john of gaunt:alas, the part i had in woodstock's blooddoth more solicit me than your exclaims,to stir against the butchers of his life!but since correction lieth in those handswhich made the fault that we cannot correct,put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.duchess:finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?hath love in thy old blood no living fire?edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,were as seven vials of his sacred blood,or seven fair branches springing from one root:some of those seven are dried by nature's course,some of those branches by the destinies cut;but thomas, my dear lord, my life, my gloucester,one vial full of edward's sacred blood,one flourishing branch of his most royal root,is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,by envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.ah, gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,that metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd theemade him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consentin some large measure to thy father's death,in that thou seest thy wretched brother die,who was the model of thy father's life.call it not patience, gaunt; it is despair:in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:that which in mean men we intitle patienceis pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.what shall i say? to safeguard thine own life,the best way is to venge my gloucester's death.john of gaunt:god's is the quarrel; for god's substitute,his deputy anointed in his sight,hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,let heaven revenge; for i may never liftan angry arm against his minister.duchess:where then, alas, may i complain myself?john of gaunt:to god, the widow's champion and defence.duchess:why, then, i will. farewell, old gaunt.thou goest to coventry, there to beholdour cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight:o, sit my husband's wrongs on hereford's spear,that it may enter butcher mowbray's breast!or, if misfortune miss the first career,be mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,they may break his foaming courser's back,and throw the rider headlong in the lists,a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford!farewell, old gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wifewith her companion grief must end her life.john of gaunt:sister, farewell; i must to coventry:as much good stay with thee as go with me!duchess:yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,not with the empty hollowness, but weight:i take my leave before i have begun,for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.commend me to thy brother, edmund york.lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;though this be all, do not so quickly go;i shall remember more. bid him--ah, what?--with all good speed at plashy visit me.alack, and what shall good old york there seebut empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?and what hear there for welcome but my groans?therefore commend me; let him not come there,to seek out sorrow that dwells every where.desolate, desolate, will i hence and die:the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.lord marshal:my lord aumerle, is harry hereford arm'd?duke of aumerle:yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.lord marshal:the duke of norfolk, sprightfully and bold,stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.duke of aumerle:why, then, the champions are prepared, and stayfor nothing but his majesty's approach.king richard ii:marshal, demand of yonder championthe cause of his arrival here in arms:ask him his name and orderly proceedto swear him in the justice of his cause.lord marshal:in god's name and the king's, say who thou artand why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;as so defend thee heaven and thy valour!thomas mowbray:my name is thomas mowbray, duke of norfolk;who hither come engaged by my oath--which god defend a knight should violate!--both to defend my loyalty and truthto god, my king and my succeeding issue,against the duke of hereford that appeals meand, by the grace of god and this mine arm,to prove him, in defending of myself,a traitor to my god, my king, and me:and as i truly fight, defend me heaven!king richard ii:marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,both who he is and why he cometh hitherthus plated in habiliments of war,and formally, according to our law,depose him in the justice of his cause.lord marshal:what is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,before king richard in his royal lists?against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!henry bolingbroke:harry of hereford, lancaster and derbyam i; who ready here do stand in arms,to prove, by god's grace and my body's valour,in lists, on thomas mowbray, duke of norfolk,that he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,to god of heaven, king richard and to me;and as i truly fight, defend me heaven!lord marshal:on pain of death, no person be so boldor daring-hardy as to touch the lists,except the marshal and such officersappointed to direct these fair designs.henry bolingbroke:lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,and bow my knee before his majesty:for mowbray and myself are like two menthat vow a long and weary pilgrimage;then let us take a ceremonious leaveand loving farewell of our several friends.lord marshal:the appellant in all duty greets your highness,and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.king richard ii:we will descend and fold him in our arms.cousin of hereford, as thy cause is right,so be thy fortune in this royal fight!farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.henry bolingbroke:o let no noble eye profane a tearfor me, if i be gored with mowbray's spear:as confident as is the falcon's flightagainst a bird, do i with mowbray fight.my loving lord, i take my leave of you;of you, my noble cousin, lord aumerle;not sick, although i have to do with death,but lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.lo, as at english feasts, so i regreetthe daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:o thou, the earthly author of my blood,whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,doth with a twofold vigour lift me upto reach at victory above my head,add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;and with thy blessings steel my lance's point,that it may enter mowbray's waxen coat,and furbish new the name of john a gaunt,even in the lusty havior of his son.john of gaunt:god in thy good cause make thee prosperous!be swift like lightning in the execution;and let thy blows, doubly redoubled,fall like amazing thunder on the casqueof thy adverse pernicious enemy:rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.henry bolingbroke:mine innocency and saint george to thrive!thomas mowbray:however god or fortune cast my lot,there lives or dies, true to king richard's throne,a loyal, just and upright gentleman:never did captive with a freer heartcast off his chains of bondage and embracehis golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,more than my dancing soul doth celebratethis feast of battle with mine adversary.most mighty liege, and my companion peers,take from my mouth the wish of happy years:as gentle and as jocund as to jestgo i to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.king richard ii:farewell, my lord: securely i espyvirtue with valour couched in thine eye.order the trial, marshal, and begin.lord marshal:harry of hereford, lancaster and derby,receive thy lance; and god defend the right!henry bolingbroke:strong as a tower in hope, i cry amen.lord marshal:go bear this lance to thomas, duke of norfolk.first herald:harry of hereford, lancaster and derby,stands here for god, his sovereign and himself,on pain to be found false and recreant,to prove the duke of norfolk, thomas mowbray,a traitor to his god, his king and him;and dares him to set forward to the fight.second herald:here standeth thomas mowbray, duke of norfolk,on pain to be found false and recreant,both to defend himself and to approvehenry of hereford, lancaster, and derby,to god, his sovereign and to him disloyal;courageously and with a free desireattending but the signal to begin.lord marshal:sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.king richard ii:let them lay by their helmets and their spears,and both return back to their chairs again:withdraw with us: and let the trumpets soundwhile we return these dukes what we decree.draw near,and list what with our council we have done.for that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'dwith that dear blood which it hath fostered;and for our eyes do hate the dire aspectof civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;and for we think the eagle-winged prideof sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,with rival-hating envy, set on youto wake our peace, which in our country's cradledraws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,with harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,and grating shock of wrathful iron arms,might from our quiet confines fright fair peaceand make us wade even in our kindred's blood,therefore, we banish you our territories:you, cousin hereford, upon pain of life,till twice five summers have enrich'd our fieldsshall not regreet our fair dominions,but tread the stranger paths of banishment.henry bolingbroke:your will be done: this must my comfort be,sun that warms you here shall shine on me;and those his golden beams to you here lentshall point on me and gild my banishment.king richard ii:norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,which i with some unwillingness pronounce:the sly slow hours shall not determinatethe dateless limit of thy dear exile;the hopeless word of 'never to return'breathe i against thee, upon pain of life.thomas mowbray:a heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,and all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:a dearer merit, not so deep a maimas to be cast forth in the common air,have i deserved at your highness' hands.the language i have learn'd these forty years,my native english, now i must forego:and now my tongue's use is to me no morethan an unstringed viol or a harp,or like a cunning instrument cased up,or, being open, put into his handsthat knows no touch to tune the harmony:within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;and dull unfeeling barren ignoranceis made my gaoler to attend on me.i am too old to fawn upon a nurse,too far in years to be a pupil now:what is thy sentence then but speechless death,which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?king richard ii:it boots thee not to be compassionate:after our sentence plaining comes too late.thomas mowbray:then thus i turn me from my country's light,to dwell in solemn shades of endless night.king richard ii:return again, and take an oath with thee.lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;swear by the duty that you owe to god--our part therein we banish with yourselves--to keep the oath that we administer:you never shall, so help you truth and god!embrace each other's love in banishment;nor never look upon each other's face;nor never write, regreet, nor reconcilethis louring tempest of your home-bred hate;nor never by advised purpose meetto plot, contrive, or complot any ill'gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.henry bolingbroke:i swear.thomas mowbray:and i, to keep all this.henry bolingbroke:norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--by this time, had the king permitted us,one of our souls had wander'd in the air.banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,as now our flesh is banish'd from this land:confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;since thou hast far to go, bear not alongthe clogging burthen of a guilty soul.thomas mowbray:no, bolingbroke: if ever i were traitor,my name be blotted from the book of life,and i from heaven banish'd as from hence!but what thou art, god, thou, and i do know;and all too soon, i fear, the king shall rue.farewell, my liege. now no way can i stray;save back to england, all the world's my way.king richard ii:uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyesi see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspecthath from the number of his banish'd yearspluck'd four away.six frozen winter spent,return with welcome home from banishment.henry bolingbroke:how long a time lies in one little word!four lagging winters and four wanton springsend in a word: such is the breath of kings.john of gaunt:i thank my liege, that in regard of mehe shortens four years of my son's exile:but little vantage shall i reap thereby;for, ere the six years that he hath to spendcan change their moons and bring their times aboutmy oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted lightshall be extinct with age and endless night;my inch of taper will be burnt and done,and blindfold death not let me see my son.king richard ii:why uncle, thou hast many years to live.john of gaunt:but not a minute, king, that thou canst give:shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,and pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;thou canst help time to furrow me with age,but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;thy word is current with him for my death,but dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.king richard ii:thy son is banish'd upon good advice,whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?john of gaunt:things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.you urged me as a judge; but i had ratheryou would have bid me argue like a father.o, had it been a stranger, not my child,to smooth his fault i should have been more mild:a partial slander sought i to avoid,and in the sentence my own life destroy'd.alas, i look'd when some of you should say,i was too strict to make mine own away;but you gave leave to my unwilling tongueagainst my will to do myself this wrong.king richard ii:cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:six years we banish him, and he shall go.duke of aumerle:cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,from where you do remain let paper show.lord marshal:my lord, no leave take i; for i will ride,as far as land will let me, by your side.john of gaunt:o, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,that thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?henry bolingbroke:i have too few to take my leave of you,when the tongue's office should be prodigalto breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.john of gaunt:thy grief is but thy absence for a time.henry bolingbroke:joy absent, grief is present for that time.john of gaunt:what is six winters? they are quickly gone.henry bolingbroke:to men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.john of gaunt:call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.henry bolingbroke:my heart will sigh when i miscall it so,which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.john of gaunt:the sullen passage of thy weary stepsesteem as foil wherein thou art to setthe precious jewel of thy home return.henry bolingbroke:nay, rather, every tedious stride i makewill but remember me what a deal of worldi wander from the jewels that i love.must i not serve a long apprenticehoodto foreign passages, and in the end,having my freedom, boast of nothing elsebut that i was a journeyman to grief?john of gaunt:all places that the eye of heaven visitsare to a wise man ports and happy havens.teach thy necessity to reason thus;there is no virtue like necessity.think not the king did banish thee,but thou the king. woe doth the heavier sit,where it perceives it is but faintly borne.go, say i sent thee forth to purchase honourand not the king exiled thee; or supposedevouring pestilence hangs in our airand thou art flying to a fresher clime:look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine itto lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:suppose the singing birds musicians,the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,the flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no morethan a delightful measure or a dance;for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bitethe man that mocks at it and sets it light.henry bolingbroke:o, who can hold a fire in his handby thinking on the frosty caucasus?or cloy the hungry edge of appetiteby bare imagination of a feast?or wallow naked in december snowby thinking on fantastic summer's heat?o, no! the apprehension of the goodgives but the greater feeling to the worse:fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle morethan when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.john of gaunt:come, come, my son, i'll bring thee on thy way:had i thy youth and cause, i would not stay.henry bolingbroke:then, england's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;my mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!where'er i wander, boast of this i can,though banish'd, yet a trueborn englishman.king richard ii:we did observe. cousin aumerle,how far brought you high hereford on his way?duke of aumerle:i brought high hereford, if you call him so,but to the next highway, and there i left him.king richard ii:and say, what store of parting tears were shed?duke of aumerle:faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,which then blew bitterly against our faces,awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chancedid grace our hollow parting with a tear.king richard ii:what said our cousin when you parted with him?duke of aumerle:'farewell:'and, for my heart disdained that my tongueshould so profane the word, that taught me craftto counterfeit oppression of such griefthat words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hoursand added years to his short banishment,he should have had a volume of farewells;but since it would not, he had none of me.king richard ii:he is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,when time shall call him home from banishment,whether our kinsman come to see his friends.ourself and bushy, bagot here and greenobserved his courtship to the common people;how he did seem to dive into their heartswith humble and familiar courtesy,what reverence he did throw away on slaves,wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smilesand patient underbearing of his fortune,as 'twere to banish their affects with him.off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;a brace of draymen bid god speed him welland had the tribute of his supple knee,with 'thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'as were our england in reversion his,and he our subjects' next degree in hope.green:well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.now for the rebels which stand out in ireland,expedient manage must be made, my liege,ere further leisure yield them further meansfor their advantage and your highness' loss.king richard ii:we will ourself in person to this war:and, for our coffers, with too great a courtand liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,we are inforced to farm our royal realm;the revenue whereof shall furnish usfor our affairs in hand: if that come short,our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,they shall subscribe them for large sums of goldand send them after to supply our wants;for we will make for ireland presently.bushy, what news?bushy:old john of gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,suddenly taken; and hath sent post hasteto entreat your majesty to visit him.king richard ii:where lies he?bushy:at ely house.king richard ii:now put it, god, in the physician's mindto help him to his grave immediately!the lining of his coffers shall make coatsto deck our soldiers for these irish wars.come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:pray god we may make haste, and come too late!all:amen.john of gaunt:will the king come, that i may breathe my lastin wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?duke of york:vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;for all in vain comes counsel to his ear.john of gaunt:o, but they say the tongues of dying menenforce attention like deep harmony:where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.he that no more must say is listen'd morethan they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;more are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:the setting sun, and music at the close,as the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,writ in remembrance more than things long past:though richard my life's counsel would not hear,my death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.duke of york:no; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,as praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,lascivious metres, to whose venom soundthe open ear of youth doth always listen;report of fashions in proud italy,whose manners still our tardy apish nationlimps after in base imitation.where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--so it be new, there's no respect how vile--that is not quickly buzzed into his ears?then all too late comes counsel to be heard,where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.direct not him whose way himself will choose:'tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.john of gaunt:methinks i am a prophet new inspiredand thus expiring do foretell of him:his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,for violent fires soon burn out themselves;small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:light vanity, insatiate cormorant,consuming means, soon preys upon itself.this royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,this earth of majesty, this seat of mars,this other eden, demi-paradise,this fortress built by nature for herselfagainst infection and the hand of war,this happy breed of men, this little world,this precious stone set in the silver sea,which serves it in the office of a wall,or as a moat defensive to a house,against the envy of less happier lands,this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this england,this nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,renowned for their deeds as far from home,for christian service and true chivalry,as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry,of the world's ransom, blessed mary's son,this land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,dear for her reputation through the world,is now leased out, i die pronouncing it,like to a tenement or pelting farm:england, bound in with the triumphant seawhose rocky shore beats back the envious siegeof watery neptune, is now bound in with shame,with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:that england, that was wont to conquer others,hath made a shameful conquest of itself.ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,how happy then were my ensuing death!duke of york:the king is come: deal mildly with his youth;for young hot colts being raged do rage the more.queen:how fares our noble uncle, lancaster?king richard ii:what comfort, man? how is't with aged gaunt?john of gaunt:o how that name befits my composition!old gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?for sleeping england long time have i watch'd;watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:the pleasure that some fathers feed upon,is my strict fast; i mean, my children's looks;and therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:gaunt am i for the grave, gaunt as a grave,whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.king richard ii:can sick men play so nicely with their names?john of gaunt:no, misery makes sport to mock itself:since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,i mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.king richard ii:should dying men flatter with those that live?john of gaunt:no, no, men living flatter those that die.king richard ii:thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.john of gaunt:o, no! thou diest, though i the sicker be.king richard ii:i am in health, i breathe, and see thee ill.john of gaunt:now he that made me knows i see thee ill;ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.thy death-bed is no lesser than thy landwherein thou liest in reputation sick;and thou, too careless patient as thou art,commit'st thy anointed body to the cureof those physicians that first wounded thee:a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,whose compass is no bigger than thy head;and yet, incaged in so small a verge,the waste is no whit lesser than thy land.o, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eyeseen how his son's son should destroy his sons,from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,which art possess'd now to depose thyself.why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,it were a shame to let this land by lease;but for thy world enjoying but this land,is it not more than shame to shame it so?landlord of england art thou now, not king:thy state of law is bondslave to the law; and thou--king richard ii:a lunatic lean-witted fool,presuming on an ague's privilege,darest with thy frozen admonitionmake pale our cheek, chasing the royal bloodwith fury from his native residence.now, by my seat's right royal majesty,wert thou not brother to great edward's son,this tongue that runs so roundly in thy headshould run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.john of gaunt:o, spare me not, my brother edward's son,for that i was his father edward's son;that blood already, like the pelican,hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:my brother gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!may be a precedent and witness goodthat thou respect'st not spilling edward's blood:join with the present sickness that i have;and thy unkindness be like crooked age,to crop at once a too long wither'd flower.live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!these words hereafter thy tormentors be!convey me to my bed, then to my grave:love they to live that love and honour have.king richard ii:and let them die that age and sullens have;for both hast thou, and both become the grave.duke of york:i do beseech your majesty, impute his wordsto wayward sickliness and age in him:he loves you, on my life, and holds you dearas harry duke of hereford, were he here.king richard ii:right, you say true: as hereford's love, so his;as theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.northumberland:my liege, old gaunt commends him to your majesty.king richard ii:what says he?northumberland:nay, nothing; all is saidhis tongue is now a stringless instrument;words, life and all, old lancaster hath spent.duke of york:be york the next that must be bankrupt so!though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.king richard ii:the ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;his time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.so much for that. now for our irish wars:we must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,which live like venom where no venom elsebut only they have privilege to live.and for these great affairs do ask some charge,towards our assistance we do seize to usthe plate, corn, revenues and moveables,whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess'd.duke of york:how long shall i be patient? ah, how longshall tender duty make me suffer wrong?not gloucester's death, nor hereford's banishmentnot gaunt's rebukes, nor england's private wrongs,nor the prevention of poor bolingbrokeabout his marriage, nor my own disgrace,have ever made me sour my patient cheek,or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.i am the last of noble edward's sons,of whom thy father, prince of wales, was first:in war was never lion raged more fierce,in peace was never gentle lamb more mild,than was that young and princely gentleman.his face thou hast, for even so look'd he,accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;but when he frown'd, it was against the frenchand not against his friends; his noble handdid will what he did spend and spent not thatwhich his triumphant father's hand had won;his hands were guilty of no kindred blood,but bloody with the enemies of his kin.o richard! york is too far gone with grief,or else he never would compare between.king richard ii:why, uncle, what's the matter?duke of york:o my liege,pardon me, if you please; if not, i, pleasednot to be pardon'd, am content withal.seek you to seize and gripe into your handsthe royalties and rights of banish'd hereford?is not gaunt dead, and doth not hereford live?was not gaunt just, and is not harry true?did not the one deserve to have an heir?is not his heir a well-deserving son?take hereford's rights away, and take from timehis charters and his customary rights;let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;be not thyself; for how art thou a kingbut by fair sequence and succession?now, afore god--god forbid i say true!--if you do wrongfully seize hereford's rights,call in the letters patent that he hathby his attorneys-general to suehis livery, and deny his offer'd homage,you pluck a thousand dangers on your head,you lose a thousand well-disposed heartsand prick my tender patience, to those thoughtswhich honour and allegiance cannot think.king richard ii:think what you will, we seize into our handshis plate, his goods, his money and his lands.duke of york:i'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:what will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;but by bad courses may be understoodthat their events can never fall out good.king richard ii:go, bushy, to the earl of wiltshire straight:bid him repair to us to ely houseto see this business. to-morrow nextwe will for ireland; and 'tis time, i trow:and we create, in absence of ourself,our uncle york lord governor of england;for he is just and always loved us well.come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;be merry, for our time of stay is shortnorthumberland:well, lords, the duke of lancaster is dead.lord ross:and living too; for now his son is duke.lord willoughby:barely in title, not in revenue.northumberland:richly in both, if justice had her right.lord ross:my heart is great; but it must break with silence,ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.northumberland:nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak morethat speaks thy words again to do thee harm!lord willoughby:tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford?if it be so, out with it boldly, man;quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.lord ross:no good at all that i can do for him;unless you call it good to pity him,bereft and gelded of his patrimony.northumberland:now, afore god, 'tis shame such wrongs are bornein him, a royal prince, and many moeof noble blood in this declining land.the king is not himself, but basely ledby flatterers; and what they will inform,merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,that will the king severely prosecute'gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.lord ross:the commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,and quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he finedfor ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.lord willoughby:and daily new exactions are devised,as blanks, benevolences, and i wot not what:but what, o' god's name, doth become of this?northumberland:wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,but basely yielded upon compromisethat which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:more hath he spent in peace than they in wars.lord ross:the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm.lord willoughby:the king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.northumberland:reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.lord ross:he hath not money for these irish wars,his burthenous taxations notwithstanding,but by the robbing of the banish'd duke.northumberland:his noble kinsman: most degenerate king!but, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;we see the wind sit sore upon our sails,and yet we strike not, but securely perish.lord ross:we see the very wreck that we must suffer;and unavoided is the danger now,for suffering so the causes of our wreck.northumberland:not so; even through the hollow eyes of deathi spy life peering; but i dare not sayhow near the tidings of our comfort is.lord willoughby:nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.lord ross:be confident to speak, northumberland:we three are but thyself; and, speaking so,thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.northumberland:then thus: i have from port le blanc, a bayin brittany, received intelligencethat harry duke of hereford, rainold lord cobham,that late broke from the duke of exeter,his brother, archbishop late of canterbury,sir thomas erpingham, sir john ramston,sir john norbery, sir robert waterton and francis quoint,all these well furnish'd by the duke of bretagnewith eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,are making hither with all due expedienceand shortly mean to touch our northern shore:perhaps they had ere this, but that they staythe first departing of the king for ireland.if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,imp out our drooping country's broken wing,redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's giltand make high majesty look like itself,away with me in post to ravenspurgh;but if you faint, as fearing to do so,stay and be secret, and myself will go.lord ross:to horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.lord willoughby:hold out my horse, and i will first be there.bushy:madam, your majesty is too much sad:you promised, when you parted with the king,to lay aside life-harming heavinessand entertain a cheerful disposition.queen:to please the king i did; to please myselfi cannot do it; yet i know no causewhy i should welcome such a guest as grief,save bidding farewell to so sweet a guestas my sweet richard: yet again, methinks,some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,is coming towards me, and my inward soulwith nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,more than with parting from my lord the king.bushy:each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,which shows like grief itself, but is not so;for sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,divides one thing entire to many objects;like perspectives, which rightly gazed uponshow nothing but confusion, eyed awrydistinguish form: so your sweet majesty,looking awry upon your lord's departure,find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadowsof what it is not. then, thrice-gracious queen,more than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,which for things true weeps things imaginary.queen:it may be so; but yet my inward soulpersuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,i cannot but be sad; so heavy sadas, though on thinking on no thought i think,makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.bushy:'tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.queen:'tis nothing less: conceit is still derivedfrom some forefather grief; mine is not so,for nothing had begot my something grief;or something hath the nothing that i grieve:'tis in reversion that i do possess;but what it is, that is not yet known; whati cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, i wot.green:god save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:i hope the king is not yet shipp'd for ireland.queen:why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;for his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?green:that he, our hope, might have retired his power,and driven into despair an enemy's hope,who strongly hath set footing in this land:the banish'd bolingbroke repeals himself,and with uplifted arms is safe arrivedat ravenspurgh.queen:now god in heaven forbid!green:ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,the lord northumberland, his son young henry percy,the lords of ross, beaumond, and willoughby,with all their powerful friends, are fled to him.bushy:why have you not proclaim'd northumberlandand all the rest revolted faction traitors?green:we have: whereupon the earl of worcesterhath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,and all the household servants fled with himto bolingbroke.queen:so, green, thou art the midwife to my woe,and bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,and i, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.bushy:despair not, madam.queen:who shall hinder me?i will despair, and be at enmitywith cozening hope: he is a flatterer,a parasite, a keeper back of death,who gently would dissolve the bands of life,which false hope lingers in extremity.green:here comes the duke of york.queen:with signs of war about his aged neck:o, full of careful business are his looks!uncle, for god's sake, speak comfortable words.duke of york:should i do so, i should belie my thoughts:comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.your husband, he is gone to save far off,whilst others come to make him lose at home:here am i left to underprop his land,who, weak with age, cannot support myself:now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.servant:my lord, your son was gone before i came.duke of york:he was? why, so! go all which way it will!the nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,and will, i fear, revolt on hereford's side.sirrah, get thee to plashy, to my sister gloucester;bid her send me presently a thousand pound:hold, take my ring.servant:my lord, i had forgot to tell your lordship,to-day, as i came by, i called there;but i shall grieve you to report the rest.duke of york:what is't, knave?servant:an hour before i came, the duchess died.duke of york:god for his mercy! what a tide of woescomes rushing on this woeful land at once!i know not what to do: i would to god,so my untruth had not provoked him to it,the king had cut off my head with my brother's.what, are there no posts dispatch'd for ireland?how shall we do for money for these wars?come, sister,--cousin, i would say--pray, pardon me.go, fellow, get thee home, provide some cartsand bring away the armour that is there.gentlemen, will you go muster men?if i know how or which way to order these affairsthus thrust disorderly into my hands,never believe me. both are my kinsmen:the one is my sovereign, whom both my oathand duty bids defend; the other againis my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.well, somewhat we must do. come, cousin, i'lldispose of you.gentlemen, go, muster up your men,and meet me presently at berkeley.i should to plashy too;but time will not permit: all is uneven,and every thing is left at six and seven.bushy:the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland,but none returns. for us to levy powerproportionable to the enemyis all unpossible.green:besides, our nearness to the king in loveis near the hate of those love not the king.bagot:and that's the wavering commons: for their lovelies in their purses, and whoso empties themby so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.bushy:wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.bagot:if judgement lie in them, then so do we,because we ever have been near the king.green:well, i will for refuge straight to bristol castle:the earl of wiltshire is already there.bushy:thither will i with you; for little officethe hateful commons will perform for us,except like curs to tear us all to pieces.will you go along with us?bagot:no; i will to ireland to his majesty.farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,we three here art that ne'er shall meet again.bushy:that's as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke.green:alas, poor duke! the task he undertakesis numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.bushy:well, we may meet again.bagot:i fear me, never.henry bolingbroke:how far is it, my lord, to berkeley now?northumberland:believe me, noble lord,i am a stranger here in gloucestershire:these high wild hills and rough uneven waysdraws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,making the hard way sweet and delectable.but i bethink me what a weary wayfrom ravenspurgh to cotswold will be foundin ross and willoughby, wanting your company,which, i protest, hath very much beguiledthe tediousness and process of my travel:but theirs is sweetened with the hope to havethe present benefit which i possess;and hope to joy is little less in joythan hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lordsshall make their way seem short, as mine hath doneby sight of what i have, your noble company.henry bolingbroke:of much less value is my companythan your good words. but who comes here?northumberland:it is my son, young harry percy,sent from my brother worcester, whencesoever.harry, how fares your uncle?henry percy:i had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.northumberland:why, is he not with the queen?henry percy:no, my good lord; he hath forsook the court,broken his staff of office and dispersedthe household of the king.northumberland:what was his reason?he was not so resolved when last we spake together.henry percy:because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.but he, my lord, is gone to ravenspurgh,to offer service to the duke of hereford,and sent me over by berkeley, to discoverwhat power the duke of york had levied there;then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh.northumberland:have you forgot the duke of hereford, boy?henry percy:no, my good lord, for that is not forgotwhich ne'er i did remember: to my knowledge,i never in my life did look on him.northumberland:then learn to know him now; this is the duke.henry percy:my gracious lord, i tender you my service,such as it is, being tender, raw and young:which elder days shall ripen and confirmto more approved service and desert.henry bolingbroke:i thank thee, gentle percy; and be surei count myself in nothing else so happyas in a soul remembering my good friends;and, as my fortune ripens with thy love,it shall be still thy true love's recompense:my heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.northumberland:how far is it to berkeley? and what stirkeeps good old york there with his men of war?henry percy:there stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,mann'd with three hundred men, as i have heard;and in it are the lords of york, berkeley, and seymour;none else of name and noble estimate.northumberland:here come the lords of ross and willoughby,bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.henry bolingbroke:welcome, my lords. i wot your love pursuesa banish'd traitor: all my treasuryis yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'dshall be your love and labour's recompense.lord ross:your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.lord willoughby:and far surmounts our labour to attain it.henry bolingbroke:evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;which, till my infant fortune comes to years,stands for my bounty. but who comes here?northumberland:it is my lord of berkeley, as i guess.lord berkeley:my lord of hereford, my message is to you.henry bolingbroke:my lord, my answer is--to lancaster;and i am come to seek that name in england;and i must find that title in your tongue,before i make reply to aught you say.lord berkeley:mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaningto raze one title of your honour out:to you, my lord, i come, what lord you will,from the most gracious regent of this land,the duke of york, to know what pricks you onto take advantage of the absent timeand fright our native peace with self-born arms.henry bolingbroke:i shall not need transport my words by you;here comes his grace in person. my noble uncle!duke of york:show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,whose duty is deceiveable and false.henry bolingbroke:my gracious uncle--duke of york:tut, tut!grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:i am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'in an ungracious mouth is but profane.why have those banish'd and forbidden legsdared once to touch a dust of england's ground?but then more 'why?' why have they dared to marchso many miles upon her peaceful bosom,frighting her pale-faced villages with warand ostentation of despised arms?comest thou because the anointed king is hence?why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,and in my loyal bosom lies his power.were i but now the lord of such hot youthas when brave gaunt, thy father, and myselfrescued the black prince, that young mars of men,from forth the ranks of many thousand french,o, then how quickly should this arm of mine.now prisoner to the palsy, chastise theeand minister correction to thy fault!henry bolingbroke:my gracious uncle, let me know my fault:on what condition stands it and wherein?duke of york:even in condition of the worst degree,in gross rebellion and detested treason:thou art a banish'd man, and here art comebefore the expiration of thy time,in braving arms against thy sovereign.henry bolingbroke:as i was banish'd, i was banish'd hereford;but as i come, i come for lancaster.and, noble uncle, i beseech your gracelook on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:you are my father, for methinks in youi see old gaunt alive; o, then, my father,will you permit that i shall stand condemn'da wandering vagabond; my rights and royaltiespluck'd from my arms perforce and given awayto upstart unthrifts? wherefore was i born?if that my cousin king be king of england,it must be granted i am duke of lancaster.you have a son, aumerle, my noble cousin;had you first died, and he been thus trod down,he should have found his uncle gaunt a father,to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.i am denied to sue my livery here,and yet my letters-patents give me leave:my father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,and these and all are all amiss employ'd.what would you have me do? i am a subject,and i challenge law: attorneys are denied me;and therefore, personally i lay my claimto my inheritance of free descent.northumberland:the noble duke hath been too much abused.lord ross:it stands your grace upon to do him right.lord willoughby:base men by his endowments are made great.duke of york:my lords of england, let me tell you this:i have had feeling of my cousin's wrongsand laboured all i could to do him right;but in this kind to come, in braving arms,be his own carver and cut out his way,to find out right with wrong, it may not be;and you that do abet him in this kindcherish rebellion and are rebels all.northumberland:the noble duke hath sworn his coming isbut for his own;

if he serve god,we'll serve him too and be his fellow so:revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;they break their faith to god as well as us:cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:the worst is death, and death will have his day.sir stephen scroop:glad am i that your highness is so arm'dto bear the tidings of calamity.like an unseasonable stormy day,which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,as if the world were all dissolved to tears,so high above his limits swells the rageof bolingbroke, covering your fearful landwith hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.white-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalpsagainst thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,strive to speak big and clap their female jointsin stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:the very beadsmen learn to bend their bowsof double-fatal yew against thy state;yea, distaff-women manage rusty billsagainst thy seat: both young and old rebel,and all goes worse than i have power to tell.king richard ii:too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.where is the earl of wiltshire? where is bagot?what is become of bushy? where is green?that they have let the dangerous enemymeasure our confines with such peaceful steps?if we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke.sir stephen scroop:peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.king richard ii:o villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!three judases, each one thrice worse than judas!would they make peace? terrible hell make warupon their spotted souls for this offence!sir stephen scroop:sweet love, i see, changing his property,turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:again uncurse their souls; their peace is madewith heads, and not with hands; those whom you cursehave felt the worst of death's destroying woundand lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.duke of aumerle:is bushy, green, and the earl of wiltshire dead?sir stephen scroop:ay, all of them at bristol lost their heads.duke of aumerle:where is the duke my father with his power?king richard ii:no matter where; of comfort no man speak:let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;make dust our paper and with rainy eyeswrite sorrow on the bosom of the earth,let's choose executors and talk of wills:and yet not so, for what can we bequeathsave our deposed bodies to the ground?our lands, our lives and all are bolingbroke's,and nothing can we call our own but deathand that small model of the barren earthwhich serves as paste and cover to our bones.for god's sake, let us sit upon the groundand tell sad stories of the death of kings;how some have been deposed; some slain in war,some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;all murder'd: for within the hollow crownthat rounds the mortal temples of a kingkeeps death his court and there the antic sits,scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,allowing him a breath, a little scene,to monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,infusing him with self and vain conceit,as if this flesh which walls about our life,were brass impregnable, and humour'd thuscomes at the last and with a little pinbores through his castle wall, and farewell king!cover your heads and mock not flesh and bloodwith solemn reverence: throw away respect,tradition, form and ceremonious duty,for you have but mistook me all this while:i live with bread like you, feel want,taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,how can you say to me, i am a king?bishop of carlisle:my lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,but presently prevent the ways to wail.to fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,and so your follies fight against yourself.fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:and fight and die is death destroying death;where fearing dying pays death servile breath.duke of aumerle:my father hath a power; inquire of himand learn to make a body of a limb.king richard ii:thou chidest me well: proud bolingbroke, i cometo change blows with thee for our day of doom.this ague fit of fear is over-blown;an easy task it is to win our own.say, scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.sir stephen scroop:men judge by the complexion of the skythe state and inclination of the day:so may you by my dull and heavy eye,my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.i play the torturer, by small and smallto lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:your uncle york is join'd with bolingbroke,and all your northern castles yielded up,and all your southern gentlemen in armsupon his party.king richard ii:thou hast said enough.beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forthof that sweet way i was in to despair!what say you now? what comfort have we now?by heaven, i'll hate him everlastinglythat bids me be of comfort any more.go to flint castle: there i'll pine away;a king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.that power i have, discharge; and let them goto ear the land that hath some hope to grow,for i have none: let no man speak againto alter this, for counsel is but vain.duke of aumerle:my liege, one word.king richard ii:he does me double wrongthat wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.discharge my followers: let them hence away,from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day.henry bolingbroke:so that by this intelligence we learnthe welshmen are dispersed, and salisburyis gone to meet the king, who lately landedwith some few private friends upon this coast.northumberland:the news is very fair and good, my lord:richard not far from hence hath hid his head.duke of york:it would beseem the lord northumberlandto say 'king richard:' alack the heavy daywhen such a sacred king should hide his head.northumberland:your grace mistakes; only to be briefleft i his title out.duke of york:the time hath been,would you have been so brief with him, he wouldhave been so brief with you, to shorten you,for taking so the head, your whole head's length.henry bolingbroke:mistake not, uncle, further than you should.duke of york:take not, good cousin, further than you should.lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.henry bolingbroke:i know it, uncle, and oppose not myselfagainst their will. but who comes here?welcome, harry: what, will not this castle yield?henry percy:the castle royally is mann'd, my lord,against thy entrance.henry bolingbroke:royally!why, it contains no king?henry percy:yes, my good lord,it doth contain a king; king richard lieswithin the limits of yon lime and stone:and with him are the lord aumerle, lord salisbury,sir stephen scroop, besides a clergymanof holy reverence; who, i cannot learn.northumberland:o, belike it is the bishop of carlisle.henry bolingbroke:noble lords,go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;through brazen trumpet send the breath of parleyinto his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:henry bolingbrokeon both his knees doth kiss king richard's handand sends allegiance and true faith of heartto his most royal person, hither comeeven at his feet to lay my arms and power,provided that my banishment repeal'dand lands restored again be freely granted:if not, i'll use the advantage of my powerand lay the summer's dust with showers of bloodrain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd englishmen:the which, how far off from the mind of bolingbrokeit is, such crimson tempest should bedrenchthe fresh green lap of fair king richard's land,my stooping duty tenderly shall show.go, signify as much, while here we marchupon the grassy carpet of this plain.let's march without the noise of threatening drum,that from this castle's tatter'd battlementsour fair appointments may be well perused.methinks king richard and myself should meetwith no less terror than the elementsof fire and water, when their thundering shockat meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.be he the fire, i'll be the yielding water:the rage be his, whilst on the earth i rainmy waters; on the earth, and not on him.march on, and mark king richard how he looks.see, see, king richard doth himself appear,as doth the blushing discontented sunfrom out the fiery portal of the east,when he perceives the envious clouds are bentto dim his glory and to stain the trackof his bright passage to the occident.duke of york:yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,as bright as is the eagle's, lightens forthcontrolling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,that any harm should stain so fair a show!king richard ii:we are amazed; and thus long have we stoodto watch the fearful bending of thy knee,because we thought ourself thy lawful king:and if we be, how dare thy joints forgetto pay their awful duty to our presence?if we be not, show us the hand of godthat hath dismissed us from our stewardship;for well we know, no hand of blood and bonecan gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.and though you think that all, as you have done,have torn their souls by turning them from us,and we are barren and bereft of friends;yet know, my master, god omnipotent,is mustering in his clouds on our behalfarmies of pestilence; and they shall strikeyour children yet unborn and unbegot,that lift your vassal hands against my headand threat the glory of my precious crown.tell bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--that every stride he makes upon my landis dangerous treason: he is come to openthe purple testament of bleeding war;but ere the crown he looks for live in peace,ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sonsshall ill become the flower of england's face,change the complexion of her maid-pale peaceto scarlet indignation and bedewher pastures' grass with faithful english blood.northumberland:the king of heaven forbid our lord the kingshould so with civil and uncivil armsbe rush'd upon! thy thrice noble cousinharry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;and by the honourable tomb he swears,that stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,and by the royalties of both your bloods,currents that spring from one most gracious head,and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt,and by the worth and honour of himself,comprising all that may be sworn or said,his coming hither hath no further scopethan for his lineal royalties and to begenfranchisement immediate on his knees:which on thy royal party granted once,his glittering arms he will commend to rust,his barbed steeds to stables, and his heartto faithful service of your majesty.this swears he, as he is a prince, is just;and, as i am a gentleman, i credit him.king richard ii:northumberland, say thus the king returns:his noble cousin is right welcome hither;and all the number of his fair demandsshall be accomplish'd without contradiction:with all the gracious utterance thou hastspeak to his gentle hearing kind commends.we do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,to look so poorly and to speak so fair?shall we call back northumberland, and senddefiance to the traitor, and so die?duke of aumerle:no, good my lord; let's fight with gentle wordstill time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.king richard ii:o god, o god! that e'er this tongue of mine,that laid the sentence of dread banishmenton yon proud man, should take it off againwith words of sooth! o that i were as greatas is my grief, or lesser than my name!or that i could forget what i have been,or not remember what i must be now!swell'st thou, proud heart? i'll give thee scope to beat,since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.duke of aumerle:northumberland comes back from bolingbroke.king richard ii:what must the king do now? must he submit?the king shall do it: must he be deposed?the king shall be contented: must he losethe name of king? o' god's name, let it go:i'll give my jewels for a set of beads,my gorgeous palace for a hermitage,my gay apparel for an almsman's gown,my figured goblets for a dish of wood,my sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,my subjects for a pair of carved saintsand my large kingdom for a little grave,a little little grave, an obscure grave;or i'll be buried in the king's highway,some way of common trade, where subjects' feetmay hourly trample on their sovereign's head;for on my heart they tread now whilst i live;and buried once, why not upon my head?aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!we'll make foul weather with despised tears;our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,and make a dearth in this revolting land.or shall we play the wantons with our woes,and make some pretty match with shedding tears?as thus, to drop them still upon one place,till they have fretted us a pair of graveswithin the earth; and, therein laid,--there liestwo kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.would not this ill do well? well, well, i seei talk but idly, and you laugh at me.most mighty prince, my lord northumberland,what says king bolingbroke? will his majestygive richard leave to live till richard die?you make a leg, and bolingbroke says ay.northumberland:my lord, in the base court he doth attendto speak with you; may it please you to come down.king richard ii:down, down i come; like glistering phaethon,wanting the manage of unruly jades.in the base court? base court, where kings grow base,to come at traitors' calls and do them grace.in the base court? come down? down, court!down, king!for night-owls shriek where mounting larksshould sing.henry bolingbroke:what says his majesty?northumberland:sorrow and grief of heartmakes him speak fondly, like a frantic manyet he is come.henry bolingbroke:stand all apart,and show fair duty to his majesty.my gracious lord,--king richard ii:fair cousin, you debase your princely kneeto make the base earth proud with kissing it:me rather had my heart might feel your lovethan my unpleased eye see your courtesy.up, cousin, up; your heart is up, i know,thus high at least, although your knee be low.henry bolingbroke:my gracious lord, i come but for mine own.king richard ii:your own is yours, and i am yours, and all.henry bolingbroke:so far be mine, my most redoubted lord,as my true service shall deserve your love.king richard ii:well you deserve: they well deserve to have,that know the strong'st and surest way to get.uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;tears show their love, but want their remedies.cousin, i am too young to be your father,though you are old enough to be my heir.what you will have, i'll give, and willing too;for do we must what force will have us do.set on towards london, cousin, is it so?henry bolingbroke:yea, my good lord.king richard ii:then i must not say no.queen:what sport shall we devise here in this garden,to drive away the heavy thought of care?lady:madam, we'll play at bowls.queen:'twill make me think the world is full of rubs,and that my fortune rubs against the bias.lady:madam, we'll dance.queen:my legs can keep no measure in delight,when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.lady:madam, we'll tell tales.queen:of sorrow or of joy?lady:of either, madam.queen:of neither, girl:for of joy, being altogether wanting,it doth remember me the more of sorrow;or if of grief, being altogether had,it adds more sorrow to my want of joy:for what i have i need not to repeat;and what i want it boots not to complain.lady:madam, i'll sing.queen:'tis well that thou hast causebut thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.lady:i could weep, madam, would it do you good.queen:and i could sing, would weeping do me good,and never borrow any tear of thee.but stay, here come the gardeners:let's step into the shadow of these trees.my wretchedness unto a row of pins,they'll talk of state; for every one doth soagainst a change; woe is forerun with woe.gardener:go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,which, like unruly children, make their sirestoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:give some supportance to the bending twigs.go thou, and like an executioner,cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,that look too lofty in our commonwealth:all must be even in our government.you thus employ'd, i will go root awaythe noisome weeds, which without profit suckthe soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.servant:why should we in the compass of a palekeep law and form and due proportion,showing, as in a model, our firm estate,when our sea-walled garden, the whole land,is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbsswarming with caterpillars?gardener:hold thy peace:he that hath suffer'd this disorder'd springhath now himself met with the fall of leaf:the weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,that seem'd in eating him to hold him up,are pluck'd up root and all by bolingbroke,i mean the earl of wiltshire, bushy, green.servant:what, are they dead?gardener:they are; and bolingbrokehath seized the wasteful king. o, what pity is itthat he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his landas we this garden! we at time of yeardo wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,with too much riches it confound itself:had he done so to great and growing men,they might have lived to bear and he to tastetheir fruits of duty: superfluous brancheswe lop away, that bearing boughs may live:had he done so, himself had borne the crown,which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.servant:what, think you then the king shall be deposed?gardener:depress'd he is already, and deposed'tis doubt he will be: letters came last nightto a dear friend of the good duke of york's,that tell black tidings.queen:o, i am press'd to death through want of speaking!thou, old adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?what eve, what serpent, hath suggested theeto make a second fall of cursed man?why dost thou say king richard is deposed?darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,divine his downfall? say, where, when, and how,camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.gardener:pardon me, madam: little joy have ito breathe this news;

and there at venice gavehis body to that pleasant country's earth,and his pure soul unto his captain christ,under whose colours he had fought so long.henry bolingbroke:why, bishop, is norfolk dead?bishop of carlisle:as surely as i live, my lord.henry bolingbroke:sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosomof good old abraham! lords appellants,your differences shall all rest under gagetill we assign you to your days of trial.duke of york:great duke of lancaster, i come to theefrom plume-pluck'd richard; who with willing souladopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yieldsto the possession of thy royal hand:ascend his throne, descending now from him;and long live henry, fourth of that name!henry bolingbroke:in god's name, i'll ascend the regal throne.bishop of carlisle:marry. god forbid!worst in this royal presence may i speak,yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.would god that any in this noble presencewere enough noble to be upright judgeof noble richard! then true noblesse wouldlearn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.what subject can give sentence on his king?and who sits here that is not richard's subject?thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,although apparent guilt be seen in them;and shall the figure of god's majesty,his captain, steward, deputy-elect,anointed, crowned, planted many years,be judged by subject and inferior breath,and he himself not present? o, forfend it, god,that in a christian climate souls refinedshould show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!i speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,stirr'd up by god, thus boldly for his king:my lord of hereford here, whom you call king,is a foul traitor to proud hereford's king:and if you crown him, let me prophesy:the blood of english shall manure the ground,and future ages groan for this foul act;peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels,and in this seat of peace tumultuous warsshall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;disorder, horror, fear and mutinyshall here inhabit, and this land be call'dthe field of golgotha and dead men's skulls.o, if you raise this house against this house,it will the woefullest division provethat ever fell upon this cursed earth.prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!northumberland:well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,of capital treason we arrest you here.my lord of westminster, be it your chargeto keep him safely till his day of trial.may it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.henry bolingbroke:fetch hither richard, that in common viewhe may surrender; so we shall proceedwithout suspicion.duke of york:i will be his conduct.henry bolingbroke:lords, you that here are under our arrest,procure your sureties for your days of answer.little are we beholding to your love,and little look'd for at your helping hands.king richard ii:alack, why am i sent for to a king,before i have shook off the regal thoughtswherewith i reign'd? i hardly yet have learn'dto insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:give sorrow leave awhile to tutor meto this submission. yet i well rememberthe favours of these men: were they not mine?did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?so judas did to christ: but he, in twelve,found truth in all but one: i, in twelve thousand, none.god save the king! will no man say amen?am i both priest and clerk? well then, amen.god save the king! although i be not he;and yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.to do what service am i sent for hither?duke of york:to do that office of thine own good willwhich tired majesty did make thee offer,the resignation of thy state and crownto henry bolingbroke.king richard ii:give me the crown. here, cousin, seize the crown;here cousin:on this side my hand, and on that side yours.now is this golden crown like a deep wellthat owes two buckets, filling one another,the emptier ever dancing in the air,the other down, unseen and full of water:that bucket down and full of tears am i,drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.henry bolingbroke:i thought you had been willing to resign.king richard ii:my crown i am; but still my griefs are mine:you may my glories and my state depose,but not my griefs; still am i king of those.henry bolingbroke:part of your cares you give me with your crown.king richard ii:your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.my care is loss of care, by old care done;your care is gain of care, by new care won:the cares i give i have, though given away;they tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.henry bolingbroke:are you contented to resign the crown?king richard ii:ay, no; no, ay; for i must nothing be;therefore no no, for i resign to thee.now mark me, how i will undo myself;i give this heavy weight from off my headand this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,the pride of kingly sway from out my heart;with mine own tears i wash away my balm,with mine own hands i give away my crown,with mine own tongue deny my sacred state,with mine own breath release all duty's rites:all pomp and majesty i do forswear;my manors, rents, revenues i forego;my acts, decrees, and statutes i deny:god pardon all oaths that are broke to me!god keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,and thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit,and soon lie richard in an earthly pit!god save king harry, unking'd richard says,and send him many years of sunshine days!what more remains?northumberland:no more, but that you readthese accusations and these grievous crimescommitted by your person and your followersagainst the state and profit of this land;that, by confessing them, the souls of menmay deem that you are worthily deposed.king richard ii:must i do so? and must i ravel outmy weaved-up folly? gentle northumberland,if thy offences were upon record,would it not shame thee in so fair a troopto read a lecture of them? if thou wouldst,there shouldst thou find one heinous article,containing the deposing of a kingand cracking the strong warrant of an oath,mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:nay, all of you that stand and look upon,whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,though some of you with pilate wash your handsshowing an outward pity; yet you pilateshave here deliver'd me to my sour cross,and water cannot wash away your sin.northumberland:my lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.king richard ii:mine eyes are full of tears, i cannot see:and yet salt water blinds them not so muchbut they can see a sort of traitors here.nay, if i turn mine eyes upon myself,i find myself a traitor with the rest;for i have given here my soul's consentto undeck the pompous body of a king;made glory base and sovereignty a slave,proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.northumberland:my lord,--king richard ii:no lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,nor no man's lord; i have no name, no title,no, not that name was given me at the font,but 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,that i have worn so many winters out,and know not now what name to call myself!o that i were a mockery king of snow,standing before the sun of bolingbroke,to melt myself away in water-drops!good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,an if my word be sterling yet in england,let it command a mirror hither straight,that it may show me what a face i have,since it is bankrupt of his majesty.henry bolingbroke:go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.northumberland:read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.king richard ii:fiend, thou torment'st me ere i come to hell!henry bolingbroke:urge it no more, my lord northumberland.northumberland:the commons will not then be satisfied.king richard ii:they shall be satisfied: i'll read enough,when i do see the very book indeedwhere all my sins are writ, and that's myself.give me the glass, and therein will i read.no deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struckso many blows upon this face of mine,and made no deeper wounds? o flattering glass,like to my followers in prosperity,thou dost beguile me! was this face the facethat every day under his household roofdid keep ten thousand men? was this the facethat, like the sun, did make beholders wink?was this the face that faced so many follies,and was at last out-faced by bolingbroke?a brittle glory shineth in this face:as brittle as the glory is the face;for there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,how soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.henry bolingbroke:the shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'dthe shadow or your face.king richard ii:say that again.the shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:'tis very true, my grief lies all within;and these external manners of lamentsare merely shadows to the unseen griefthat swells with silence in the tortured soul;there lies the substance: and i thank thee, king,for thy great bounty, that not only givestme cause to wail but teachest me the wayhow to lament the cause. i'll beg one boon,and then be gone and trouble you no more.shall i obtain it?henry bolingbroke:name it, fair cousin.king richard ii:'fair cousin'? i am greater than a king:for when i was a king, my flattererswere then but subjects; being now a subject,i have a king here to my flatterer.being so great, i have no need to beg.henry bolingbroke:yet ask.king richard ii:and shall i have?henry bolingbroke:you shall.king richard ii:then give me leave to go.henry bolingbroke:whither?king richard ii:whither you will, so i were from your sights.henry bolingbroke:go, some of you convey him to the tower.king richard ii:o, good! convey? conveyers are you all,that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.henry bolingbroke:on wednesday next we solemnly set downour coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.abbot:a woeful pageant have we here beheld.bishop of carlisle:the woe's to come; the children yet unborn.shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.duke of aumerle:you holy clergymen, is there no plotto rid the realm of this pernicious blot?abbot:my lord,before i freely speak my mind herein,you shall not only take the sacramentto bury mine intents, but also to effectwhatever i shall happen to devise.i see your brows are full of discontent,your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:come home with me to supper; and i'll laya plot shall show us all a merry day.queen:this way the king will come; this is the wayto julius caesar's ill-erected tower,to whose flint bosom my condemned lordis doom'd a prisoner by proud bolingbroke:here let us rest, if this rebellious earthhave any resting for her true king's queen.but soft, but see, or rather do not see,my fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,that you in pity may dissolve to dew,and wash him fresh again with true-love tears.ah, thou, the model where old troy did stand,thou map of honour, thou king richard's tomb,and not king richard; thou most beauteous inn,why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,when triumph is become an alehouse guest?king richard ii:join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,to make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,to think our former state a happy dream;from which awaked, the truth of what we areshows us but this: i am sworn brother, sweet,to grim necessity, and he and iwill keep a league till death. hie thee to franceand cloister thee in some religious house:our holy lives must win a new world's crown,which our profane hours here have stricken down.queen:what, is my richard both in shape and mindtransform'd and weaken'd? hath bolingbroke deposedthine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,and wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rageto be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,and fawn on rage with base humility,which art a lion and a king of beasts?king richard ii:a king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,i had been still a happy king of men.good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for france:think i am dead and that even here thou takest,as from my death-bed, thy last living leave.in winter's tedious nights sit by the firewith good old folks and let them tell thee talesof woeful ages long ago betid;and ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,tell thou the lamentable tale of meand send the hearers weeping to their beds:for why, the senseless brands will sympathizethe heavy accent of thy moving tongueand in compassion weep the fire out;and some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,for the deposing of a rightful king.northumberland:my lord, the mind of bolingbroke is changed:you must to pomfret, not unto the tower.and, madam, there is order ta'en for you;with all swift speed you must away to france.king richard ii:northumberland, thou ladder wherewithalthe mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne,the time shall not be many hours of agemore than it is ere foul sin gathering headshalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,though he divide the realm and give thee half,it is too little, helping him to all;and he shall think that thou, which know'st the wayto plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,being ne'er so little urged, another wayto pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.the love of wicked men converts to fear;that fear to hate, and hate turns one or bothto worthy danger and deserved death.northumberland:my guilt be on my head, and there an end.take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.king richard ii:doubly divorced! bad men, you violatea twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,and then betwixt me and my married wife.let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;and yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.part us, northumberland; i toward the north,where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;my wife to france: from whence, set forth in pomp,she came adorned hither like sweet may,sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day.queen:and must we be divided? must we part?king richard ii:ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.queen:banish us both and send the king with me.northumberland:that were some love but little policy.queen:then whither he goes, thither let me go.king richard ii:so two, together weeping, make one woe.weep thou for me in france, i for thee here;better far off than near, be ne'er the near.go, count thy way with sighs; i mine with groans.queen:so longest way shall have the longest moans.king richard ii:twice for one step i'll groan, the way being short,and piece the way out with a heavy heart.come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;one kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;thus give i mine, and thus take i thy heart.queen:give me mine own again; 'twere no good partto take on me to keep and kill thy heart.so, now i have mine own again, be gone,that i might strive to kill it with a groan.king richard ii:we make woe wanton with this fond delay:once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.duchess of york:my lord, you told me you would tell the rest,when weeping made you break the story off,of our two cousins coming into london.duke of york:where did i leave?duchess of york:at that sad stop, my lord,where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' topsthrew dust and rubbish on king richard's head.duke of york:then, as i said, the duke, great bolingbroke,mounted upon a hot and fiery steedwhich his aspiring rider seem'd to know,with slow but stately pace kept on his course,whilst all tongues cried 'god save thee,bolingbroke!'you would have thought the very windows spake,so many greedy looks of young and oldthrough casements darted their desiring eyesupon his visage, and that all the wallswith painted imagery had said at once'jesu preserve thee! welcome, bolingbroke!'whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,bespake them thus: 'i thank you, countrymen:'and thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.duchess of york:alack, poor richard! where rode he the whilst?duke of york:as in a theatre, the eyes of men,after a well-graced actor leaves the stage,are idly bent on him that enters next,thinking his prattle to be tedious;even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyesdid scowl on gentle richard; no man cried 'god save him!'no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:but dust was thrown upon his sacred head:which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,his face still combating with tears and smiles,the badges of his grief and patience,that had not god, for some strong purpose, steel'dthe hearts of men, they must perforce have meltedand barbarism itself have pitied him.but heaven hath a hand in these events,to whose high will we bound our calm contents.to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,whose state and honour i for aye allow.duchess of york:here comes my son aumerle.duke of york:aumerle that was;but that is lost for being richard's friend,and, madam, you must call him rutland now:i am in parliament pledge for his truthand lasting fealty to the new-made king.duchess of york:welcome, my son: who are the violets nowthat strew the green lap of the new come spring?duke of aumerle:madam, i know not, nor i greatly care not:god knows i had as lief be none as one.duke of york:well, bear you well in this new spring of time,lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.what news from oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?duke of aumerle:for aught i know, my lord, they do.duke of york:you will be there, i know.duke of aumerle:if god prevent not, i purpose so.duke of york:what seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.duke of aumerle:my lord, 'tis nothing.duke of york:no matter, then, who see it;i will be satisfied; let me see the writing.duke of aumerle:i do beseech your grace to pardon me:it is a matter of small consequence,which for some reasons i would not have seen.duke of york:which for some reasons, sir, i mean to see.i fear, i fear,--duchess of york:what should you fear?'tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd intofor gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.duke of york:bound to himself! what doth he with a bondthat he is bound to? wife, thou art a fool.boy, let me see the writing.duke of aumerle:i do beseech you, pardon me; i may not show it.duke of york:i will be satisfied; let me see it, i say.treason! foul treason! villain! traitor! slave!duchess of york:what is the matter, my lord?duke of york:ho! who is within there?saddle my horse.god for his mercy, what treachery is here!duchess of york:why, what is it, my lord?duke of york:give me my boots, i say; saddle my horse.now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,i will appeach the villain.duchess of york:what is the matter?duke of york:peace, foolish woman.duchess of york:i will not peace. what is the matter, aumerle.duke of aumerle:good mother, be content; it is no morethan my poor life must answer.duchess of york:thy life answer!duke of york:bring me my boots: i will unto the king.duchess of york:strike him, aumerle. poor boy, thou art amazed.hence, villain! never more come in my sight.duke of york:give me my boots, i say.duchess of york:why, york, what wilt thou do?wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?have we more sons? or are we like to have?is not my teeming date drunk up with time?and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,and rob me of a happy mother's name?is he not like thee? is he not thine own?duke of york:thou fond mad woman,wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?a dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,and interchangeably set down their hands,to kill the king at oxford.duchess of york:he shall be none;we'll keep him here: then what is that to him?duke of york:away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,i would appeach him.duchess of york:hadst thou groan'd for himas i have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.but now i know thy mind; thou dost suspectthat i have been disloyal to thy bed,and that he is a bastard, not thy son:sweet york, sweet husband, be not of that mind:he is as like thee as a man may be,not like to me, or any of my kin,and yet i love him.duke of york:make way, unruly woman!duchess of york:after, aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;spur post, and get before him to the king,and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.i'll not be long behind; though i be old,i doubt not but to ride as fast as york:and never will i rise up from the groundtill bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. away, be gone!henry bolingbroke:can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?'tis full three months since i did see him last;if any plague hang over us, 'tis he.i would to god, my lords, he might be found:inquire at london, 'mongst the taverns there,for there, they say, he daily doth frequent,with unrestrained loose companions,even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,and beat our watch, and rob our passengers;which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,takes on the point of honour to supportso dissolute a crew.henry percy:my lord, some two days since i saw the prince,and told him of those triumphs held at oxford.henry bolingbroke:and what said the gallant?henry percy:his answer was, he would unto the stews,and from the common'st creature pluck a glove,and wear it as a favour; and with thathe would unhorse the lustiest challenger.henry bolingbroke:as dissolute as desperate; yet through bothi see some sparks of better hope, which elder yearsmay happily bring forth. but who comes here?duke of aumerle:where is the king?henry bolingbroke:what means our cousin, that he stares and looksso wildly?duke of aumerle:god save your grace! i do beseech your majesty,to have some conference with your grace alone.henry bolingbroke:withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.what is the matter with our cousin now?duke of aumerle:for ever may my knees grow to the earth,my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouthunless a pardon ere i rise or speak.henry bolingbroke:intended or committed was this fault?if on the first, how heinous e'er it be,to win thy after-love i pardon thee.duke of aumerle:then give me leave that i may turn the key,that no man enter till my tale be done.henry bolingbroke:have thy desire.duke of york:henry bolingbroke:villain, i'll make thee safe.duke of aumerle:stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.duke of york:henry bolingbroke:what is the matter, uncle? speak;recover breath; tell us how near is danger,that we may arm us to encounter it.duke of york:peruse this writing here, and thou shalt knowthe treason that my haste forbids me show.duke of aumerle:remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:i do repent me; read not my name theremy heart is not confederate with my hand.duke of york:it was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.i tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;fear, and not love, begets his penitence:forget to pity him, lest thy pity provea serpent that will sting thee to the heart.henry bolingbroke:o heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!o loyal father of a treacherous son!thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,from when this stream through muddy passageshath held his current and defiled himself!thy overflow of good converts to bad,and thy abundant goodness shall excusethis deadly blot in thy digressing son.duke of york:so shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;and he shall spend mine honour with his shame,as thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,the traitor lives, the true man's put to death.duchess of york:henry bolingbroke:what shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?duchess of york:a woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis i.speak with me, pity me, open the door.a beggar begs that never begg'd before.henry bolingbroke:our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,and now changed to 'the beggar and the king.'my dangerous cousin, let your mother in:i know she is come to pray for your foul sin.duke of york:if thou do pardon, whosoever pray,more sins for this forgiveness prosper may.this fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;this let alone will all the rest confound.duchess of york:o king, believe not this hard-hearted man!love loving not itself none other can.duke of york:thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?duchess of york:sweet york, be patient. hear me, gentle liege.henry bolingbroke:rise up, good aunt.duchess of york:not yet, i thee beseech:for ever will i walk upon my knees,and never see day that the happy sees,till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,by pardoning rutland, my transgressing boy.duke of aumerle:unto my mother's prayers i bend my knee.duke of york:against them both my true joints bended be.ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!duchess of york:pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;his eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;his words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:he prays but faintly and would be denied;we pray with heart and soul and all beside:his weary joints would gladly rise, i know;our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:his prayers are full of false hypocrisy;ours of true zeal and deep integrity.our prayers do out-pray his; then let them havethat mercy which true prayer ought to have.henry bolingbroke:good aunt, stand up.duchess of york:nay, do not say, 'stand up;'say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'and if i were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,'pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.i never long'd to hear a word till now;say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:the word is short, but not so short as sweet;no word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.duke of york:speak it in french, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'duchess of york:dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,that set'st the word itself against the word!speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;the chopping french we do not understand.thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.henry bolingbroke:good aunt, stand up.duchess of york:i do not sue to stand;pardon is all the suit i have in hand.henry bolingbroke:i pardon him, as god shall pardon me.duchess of york:o happy vantage of a kneeling knee!yet am i sick for fear: speak it again;twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,but makes one pardon strong.henry bolingbroke:with all my hearti pardon him.duchess of york:a god on earth thou art.henry bolingbroke:but for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,with all the rest of that consorted crew,destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.good uncle, help to order several powersto oxford, or where'er these traitors are:they shall not live within this world, i swear,but i will have them, if i once know where.uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.duchess of york:come, my old son: i pray god make thee new.exton:didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,'have i no friend will rid me of this living fear?'was it not so?servant:these were his very words.exton:'have i no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,and urged it twice together, did he not?servant:he did.exton:and speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,and who should say, 'i would thou wert the man'that would divorce this terror from my heart;'meaning the king at pomfret. come, let's go:i am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.king richard ii:i have been studying how i may comparethis prison where i live unto the world:and for because the world is populousand here is not a creature but myself,i cannot do it; yet i'll hammer it out.my brain i'll prove the female to my soul,my soul the father; and these two begeta generation of still-breeding thoughts,and these same thoughts people this little world,in humours like the people of this world,for no thought is contented. the better sort,as thoughts of things divine, are intermix'dwith scruples and do set the word itselfagainst the word:as thus, 'come, little ones,' and then again,'it is as hard to come as for a camelto thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'thoughts tending to ambition, they do plotunlikely wonders; how these vain weak nailsmay tear a passage through the flinty ribsof this hard world, my ragged prison walls,and, for they cannot, die in their own pride.thoughts tending to content flatter themselvesthat they are not the first of fortune's slaves,nor shall not be the last; like silly beggarswho sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,that many have and others must sit there;and in this thought they find a kind of ease,bearing their own misfortunes on the backof such as have before endured the like.thus play i in one person many people,and none contented: sometimes am i king;then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,and so i am: then crushing penurypersuades me i was better when a king;then am i king'd again: and by and bythink that i am unking'd by bolingbroke,and straight am nothing: but whate'er i be,nor i nor any man that but man iswith nothing shall be pleased, till he be easedwith being nothing. music do i hear?ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,when time is broke and no proportion kept!so is it in the music of men's lives.and here have i the daintiness of earto cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;but for the concord of my state and timehad not an ear to hear my true time broke.i wasted time, and now doth time waste me;for now hath time made me his numbering clock:my thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jartheir watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,whereto my finger, like a dial's point,is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.now sir, the sound that tells what hour it isare clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groansshow minutes, times, and hours: but my timeruns posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy,while i stand fooling here, his jack o' the clock.this music mads me; let it sound no more;for though it have holp madmen to their wits,in me it seems it will make wise men mad.yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!for 'tis a sign of love; and love to richardis a strange brooch in this all-hating world.groom:hail, royal prince!king richard ii:thanks, noble peer;the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.what art thou? and how comest thou hither,where no man never comes but that sad dogthat brings me food to make misfortune live?groom:i was a poor groom of thy stable, king,when thou wert king; who, travelling towards york,with much ado at length have gotten leaveto look upon my sometimes royal master's face.o, how it yearn'd my heart when i beheldin london streets, that coronation-day,when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary,that horse that thou so often hast bestrid,that horse that i so carefully have dress'd!king richard ii:rode he on barbary? tell me, gentle friend,how went he under him?groom:so proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.king richard ii:so proud that bolingbroke was on his back!that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;this hand hath made him proud with clapping him.would he not stumble? would he not fall down,since pride must have a fall, and break the neckof that proud man that did usurp his back?forgiveness, horse! why do i rail on thee,since thou, created to be awed by man,wast born to bear? i was not made a horse;and yet i bear a burthen like an ass,spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing bolingbroke.keeper:fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.king richard ii:if thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.groom:what my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.keeper:my lord, will't please you to fall to?king richard ii:taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.keeper:my lord, i dare not: sir pierce of exton, wholately came from the king, commands the contrary.king richard ii:the devil take henry of lancaster and thee!patience is stale, and i am weary of it.keeper:help, help, help!king richard ii:how now! what means death in this rude assault?villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.go thou, and fill another room in hell.that hand shall burn in never-quenching firethat staggers thus my person. exton, thy fierce handhath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.exton:as full of valour as of royal blood:both have i spill'd; o would the deed were good!for now the devil, that told me i did well,says that this deed is chronicled in hell.this dead king to the living king i'll beartake hence the rest, and give them burial here.henry bolingbroke:kind uncle york, the latest news we hearis that the rebels have consumed with fireour town of cicester in gloucestershire;but whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.welcome, my lord what is the news?northumberland:first, to thy sacred state wish i all happiness.the next news is, i have to london sentthe heads of oxford, salisbury, blunt, and kent:the manner of their taking may appearat large discoursed in this paper here.henry bolingbroke:we thank thee, gentle percy, for thy pains;and to thy worth will add right worthy gains.lord fitzwater:my lord, i have from oxford sent to londonthe heads of brocas and sir bennet seely,two of the dangerous consorted traitorsthat sought at oxford thy dire overthrow.henry bolingbroke:thy pains, fitzwater, shall not be forgot;right noble is thy merit, well i wot.henry percy:the grand conspirator, abbot of westminster,with clog of conscience and sour melancholyhath yielded up his body to the grave;but here is carlisle living, to abidethy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.henry bolingbroke:carlisle, this is your doom:choose out some secret place, some reverend room,more than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;so as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:for though mine enemy thou hast ever been,high sparks of honour in thee have i seen.exton:great king, within this coffin i presentthy buried fear: herein all breathless liesthe mightiest of thy greatest enemies,richard of bordeaux, by me hither brought.henry bolingbroke:exton, i thank thee not; for thou hast wroughta deed of slander with thy fatal handupon my head and all this famous land.exton:from your own mouth, my lord, did i this deed.henry bolingbroke:they love not poison that do poison need,nor do i thee: though i did wish him dead,i hate the murderer, love him murdered.the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,but neither my good word nor princely favour:with cain go wander through shades of night,and never show thy head by day nor light.lords, i protest, my soul is full of woe,that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:come, mourn with me for that i do lament,and put on sullen black incontinent:i'll make a voyage to the holy land,to wash this blood off from my guilty hand:march sadly after; grace my mournings here;in weeping after this untimely bier.sampson:gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.gregory:no, for then we should be colliers.sampson:i mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.gregory:ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.sampson:i strike quickly, being moved.gregory:but thou art not quickly moved to strike.sampson:a dog of the house of montague moves me.gregory:to move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.sampson:a dog of that house shall move me to stand: i willtake the wall of any man or maid of montague's.gregory:that shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goesto the wall.sampson:true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,are ever thrust to the wall: therefore i will pushmontague's men from the wall, and thrust his maidsto the wall.gregory:the quarrel is between our masters and us their men.sampson:'tis all one, i will show myself a tyrant: when ihave fought with the men, i will be cruel with themaids, and cut off their heads.gregory:the heads of the maids?sampson:ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;take it in what sense thou wilt.gregory:they must take it in sense that feel it.sampson:me they shall feel while i am able to stand: and'tis known i am a pretty piece of flesh.gregory:'tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thouhadst been poor john. draw thy tool! here comestwo of the house of the montagues.sampson:my naked weapon is out: quarrel, i will back thee.gregory:how! turn thy back and run?sampson:fear me not.gregory:no, marry; i fear thee!sampson:let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.gregory:i will frown as i pass by, and let them take it asthey list.sampson:nay, as they dare. i will bite my thumb at them;which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.abraham:do you bite your thumb at us, sir?sampson:i do bite my thumb, sir.abraham:do you bite your thumb at us, sir?sampson:gregory:no.sampson:no, sir, i do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but ibite my thumb, sir.gregory:do you quarrel, sir?abraham:quarrel sir! no, sir.sampson:if you do, sir, i am for you: i serve as good a man as you.abraham:no better.sampson:well, sir.gregory:say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.sampson:yes, better, sir.abraham:you lie.sampson:draw, if you be men. gregory, remember thy swashing blow.benvolio:part, fools!put up your swords; you know not what you do.tybalt:what, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?turn thee, benvolio, look upon thy death.benvolio:i do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,or manage it to part these men with me.tybalt:what, drawn, and talk of peace! i hate the word,as i hate hell, all montagues, and thee:have at thee, coward!first citizen:clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!down with the capulets! down with the montagues!capulet:what noise is this? give me my long sword, ho!lady capulet:a crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?capulet:my sword, i say! old montague is come,and flourishes his blade in spite of me.montague:thou villain capulet,--hold me not, let me go.lady montague:thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.prince:rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--will they not hear? what, ho! you men, you beasts,that quench the fire of your pernicious ragewith purple fountains issuing from your veins,on pain of torture, from those bloody handsthrow your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,and hear the sentence of your moved prince.three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,by thee, old capulet, and montague,have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,and made verona's ancient citizenscast by their grave beseeming ornaments,to wield old partisans, in hands as old,canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:if ever you disturb our streets again,your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.for this time, all the rest depart away:you capulet; shall go along with me:and, montague, come you this afternoon,to know our further pleasure in this case,to old free-town, our common judgment-place.once more, on pain of death, all men depart.montague:who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?speak, nephew, were you by when it began?benvolio:here were the servants of your adversary,and yours, close fighting ere i did approach:i drew to part them: in the instant camethe fiery tybalt, with his sword prepared,which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,he swung about his head and cut the winds,who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:while we were interchanging thrusts and blows,came more and more and fought on part and part,till the prince came, who parted either part.lady montague:o, where is romeo? saw you him to-day?right glad i am he was not at this fray.benvolio:madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sunpeer'd forth the golden window of the east,a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;where, underneath the grove of sycamorethat westward rooteth from the city's side,so early walking did i see your son:towards him i made, but he was ware of meand stole into the covert of the wood:i, measuring his affections by my own,that most are busied when they're most alone,pursued my humour not pursuing his,and gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.montague:many a morning hath he there been seen,with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;but all so soon as the all-cheering sunshould in the furthest east begin to drawthe shady curtains from aurora's bed,away from the light steals home my heavy son,and private in his chamber pens himself,shuts up his windows, locks far daylight outand makes himself an artificial night:black and portentous must this humour prove,unless good counsel may the cause remove.benvolio:my noble uncle, do you know the cause?montague:i neither know it nor can learn of him.benvolio:have you importuned him by any means?montague:both by myself and many other friends:but he, his own affections' counsellor,is to himself--i will not say how true--but to himself so secret and so close,so far from sounding and discovery,as is the bud bit with an envious worm,ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,or dedicate his beauty to the sun.could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.we would as willingly give cure as know.benvolio:see, where he comes: so please you, step aside;i'll know his grievance, or be much denied.montague:i would thou wert so happy by thy stay,to hear true shrift. come, madam, let's away.benvolio:good-morrow, cousin.romeo:is the day so young?benvolio:but new struck nine.romeo:ay me! sad hours seem long.was that my father that went hence so fast?benvolio:it was. what sadness lengthens romeo's hours?romeo:not having that, which, having, makes them short.benvolio:in love?romeo:out--benvolio:of love?romeo:out of her favour, where i am in love.benvolio:alas, that love, so gentle in his view,should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!romeo:alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!where shall we dine? o me! what fray was here?yet tell me not, for i have heard it all.here's much to do with hate, but more with love.why, then, o brawling love! o loving hate!o any thing, of nothing first create!o heavy lightness! serious vanity!mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,sick health!still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!this love feel i, that feel no love in this.dost thou not laugh?benvolio:no, coz, i rather weep.romeo:good heart, at what?benvolio:at thy good heart's oppression.romeo:why, such is love's transgression.griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,which thou wilt propagate, to have it prestwith more of thine: this love that thou hast showndoth add more grief to too much of mine own.love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:what is it else? a madness most discreet,a choking gall and a preserving sweet.farewell, my coz.benvolio:soft! i will go along;an if you leave me so, you do me wrong.romeo:tut, i have lost myself; i am not here;this is not romeo, he's some other where.benvolio:tell me in sadness, who is that you love.romeo:what, shall i groan and tell thee?benvolio:groan! why, no.but sadly tell me who.romeo:bid a sick man in sadness make his will:ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!in sadness, cousin, i do love a woman.benvolio:i aim'd so near, when i supposed you loved.romeo:a right good mark-man! and she's fair i love.benvolio:a right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.romeo:well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hitwith cupid's arrow; she hath dian's wit;and, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,from love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.she will not stay the siege of loving terms,nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:o, she is rich in beauty, only poor,that when she dies with beauty dies her store.benvolio:then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?romeo:she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,for beauty starved with her severitycuts beauty off from all posterity.she is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,to merit bliss by making me despair:she hath forsworn to love, and in that vowdo i live dead that live to tell it now.benvolio:be ruled by me, forget to think of her.romeo:o, teach me how i should forget to think.benvolio:by giving liberty unto thine eyes;examine other beauties.romeo:'tis the wayto call hers exquisite, in question more:these happy masks that kiss fair ladies' browsbeing black put us in mind they hide the fair;he that is strucken blind cannot forgetthe precious treasure of his eyesight lost:show me a mistress that is passing fair,what doth her beauty serve, but as a notewhere i may read who pass'd that passing fair?farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.benvolio:i'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.capulet:but montague is bound as well as i,in penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, i think,for men so old as we to keep the peace.paris:of honourable reckoning are you both;and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.but now, my lord, what say you to my suit?capulet:but saying o'er what i have said before:my child is yet a stranger in the world;she hath not seen the change of fourteen years,let two more summers wither in their pride,ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.paris:younger than she are happy mothers made.capulet:and too soon marr'd are those so early made.the earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,she is the hopeful lady of my earth:but woo her, gentle paris, get her heart,my will to her consent is but a part;an she agree, within her scope of choicelies my consent and fair according voice.this night i hold an old accustom'd feast,whereto i have invited many a guest,such as i love; and you, among the store,one more, most welcome, makes my number more.at my poor house look to behold this nightearth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:such comfort as do lusty young men feelwhen well-apparell'd april on the heelof limping winter treads, even such delightamong fresh female buds shall you this nightinherit at my house; hear all, all see,and like her most whose merit most shall be:which on more view, of many mine being onemay stand in number, though in reckoning none,come, go with me.go, sirrah, trudge aboutthrough fair verona; find those persons outwhose names are written there, and to them say,my house and welcome on their pleasure stay.servant:find them out whose names are written here! it iswritten, that the shoemaker should meddle with hisyard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher withhis pencil, and the painter with his nets; but i amsent to find those persons whose names are herewrit, and can never find what names the writingperson hath here writ. i must to the learned.--in good time.benvolio:tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,one pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;one desperate grief cures with another's languish:take thou some new infection to thy eye,and the rank poison of the old will die.romeo:your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.benvolio:for what, i pray thee?romeo:for your broken shin.benvolio:why, romeo, art thou mad?romeo:not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;shut up in prison, kept without my food,whipp'd and tormented and--god-den, good fellow.servant:god gi' god-den. i pray, sir, can you read?romeo:ay, mine own fortune in my misery.servant:perhaps you have learned it without book: but, ipray, can you read any thing you see?romeo:ay, if i know the letters and the language.servant:ye say honestly: rest you merry!romeo:stay, fellow;

and, with unattainted eye,compare her face with some that i shall show,and i will make thee think thy swan a crow.romeo:when the devout religion of mine eyemaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;and these, who often drown'd could never die,transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!one fairer than my love! the all-seeing sunne'er saw her match since first the world begun.benvolio:tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,herself poised with herself in either eye:but in that crystal scales let there be weigh'dyour lady's love against some other maidthat i will show you shining at this feast,and she shall scant show well that now shows best.romeo:i'll go along, no such sight to be shown,but to rejoice in splendor of mine own.lady capulet:nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.nurse:now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,i bade her come. what, lamb! what, ladybird!god forbid! where's this girl? what, juliet!juliet:how now! who calls?nurse:your mother.juliet:madam, i am here.what is your will?lady capulet:this is the matter:--nurse, give leave awhile,we must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;i have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.nurse:faith, i can tell her age unto an hour.lady capulet:she's not fourteen.nurse:i'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--and yet, to my teeth be it spoken, i have but four--she is not fourteen. how long is it nowto lammas-tide?lady capulet:a fortnight and odd days.nurse:even or odd, of all days in the year,come lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.susan and she--god rest all christian souls!--were of an age: well, susan is with god;she was too good for me: but, as i said,on lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;that shall she, marry; i remember it well.'tis since the earthquake now eleven years;and she was wean'd,--i never shall forget it,--of all the days of the year, upon that day:for i had then laid wormwood to my dug,sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;my lord and you were then at mantua:--nay, i do bear a brain:--but, as i said,when it did taste the wormwood on the nippleof my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, i trow,to bid me trudge:and since that time it is eleven years;for then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,she could have run and waddled all about;for even the day before, she broke her brow:and then my husband--god be with his soul!a' was a merry man--took up the child:'yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;wilt thou not, jule?' and, by my holidame,the pretty wretch left crying and said 'ay.'to see, now, how a jest shall come about!i warrant, an i should live a thousand years,i never should forget it: 'wilt thou not, jule?' quoth he;and, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'ay.'lady capulet:enough of this;

o sweet juliet,thy beauty hath made me effeminateand in my temper soften'd valour's steel!benvolio:o romeo, romeo, brave mercutio's dead!that gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,which too untimely here did scorn the earth.romeo:this day's black fate on more days doth depend;this but begins the woe, others must end.benvolio:here comes the furious tybalt back again.romeo:alive, in triumph! and mercutio slain!away to heaven, respective lenity,and fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!now, tybalt, take the villain back again,that late thou gavest me; for mercutio's soulis but a little way above our heads,staying for thine to keep him company:either thou, or i, or both, must go with him.tybalt:thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,shalt with him hence.romeo:this shall determine that.benvolio:romeo, away, be gone!the citizens are up, and tybalt slain.stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,if thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!romeo:o, i am fortune's fool!benvolio:why dost thou stay?first citizen:which way ran he that kill'd mercutio?tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?benvolio:there lies that tybalt.first citizen:up, sir, go with me;i charge thee in the princes name, obey.prince:where are the vile beginners of this fray?benvolio:o noble prince, i can discover allthe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:there lies the man, slain by young romeo,that slew thy kinsman, brave mercutio.lady capulet:tybalt, my cousin!

friends, part!' and, swifter thanhis tongue,his agile arm beats down their fatal points,and 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arman envious thrust from tybalt hit the lifeof stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled;but by and by comes back to romeo,who had but newly entertain'd revenge,and to 't they go like lightning, for, ere icould draw to part them, was stout tybalt slain.and, as he fell, did romeo turn and fly.this is the truth, or let benvolio die.lady capulet:he is a kinsman to the montague;affection makes him false; he speaks not true:some twenty of them fought in this black strife,and all those twenty could but kill one life.i beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;romeo slew tybalt, romeo must not live.prince:romeo slew him, he slew mercutio;who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?montague:not romeo, prince, he was mercutio's friend;his fault concludes but what the law should end,the life of tybalt.prince:and for that offenceimmediately we do exile him hence:i have an interest in your hate's proceeding,my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;but i'll amerce you with so strong a finethat you shall all repent the loss of mine:i will be deaf to pleading and excuses;nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:therefore use none: let romeo hence in haste,else, when he's found, that hour is his last.bear hence this body and attend our will:mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.juliet:gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,towards phoebus' lodging: such a wagoneras phaethon would whip you to the west,and bring in cloudy night immediately.spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,that runaway's eyes may wink and romeoleap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.lovers can see to do their amorous ritesby their own beauties; or, if love be blind,it best agrees with night. come, civil night,thou sober-suited matron, all in black,and learn me how to lose a winning match,play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,with thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,think true love acted simple modesty.come, night; come, romeo; come, thou day in night;for thou wilt lie upon the wings of nightwhiter than new snow on a raven's back.come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,give me my romeo; and, when he shall die,take him and cut him out in little stars,and he will make the face of heaven so finethat all the world will be in love with nightand pay no worship to the garish sun.o, i have bought the mansion of a love,but not possess'd it, and, though i am sold,not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this dayas is the night before some festivalto an impatient child that hath new robesand may not wear them. o, here comes my nurse,and she brings news; and every tongue that speaksbut romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.now, nurse, what news? what hast thou there? the cordsthat romeo bid thee fetch?nurse:ay, ay, the cords.juliet:ay me!

he was not born to shame:upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;for 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'dsole monarch of the universal earth.o, what a beast was i to chide at him!nurse:will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?juliet:shall i speak ill of him that is my husband?ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,when i, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?but, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?that villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;your tributary drops belong to woe,which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.my husband lives, that tybalt would have slain;and tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:all this is comfort; wherefore weep i then?some word there was, worser than tybalt's death,that murder'd me: i would forget it fain;but, o, it presses to my memory,like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:'tybalt is dead, and romeo--banished;'that 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'hath slain ten thousand tybalts. tybalt's deathwas woe enough, if it had ended there:or, if sour woe delights in fellowshipand needly will be rank'd with other griefs,why follow'd not, when she said 'tybalt's dead,'thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,which modern lamentations might have moved?but with a rear-ward following tybalt's death,'romeo is banished,' to speak that word,is father, mother, tybalt, romeo, juliet,all slain, all dead. 'romeo is banished!'there is no end, no limit, measure, bound,in that word's death; no words can that woe sound.where is my father, and my mother, nurse?nurse:weeping and wailing over tybalt's corse:will you go to them? i will bring you thither.juliet:wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,when theirs are dry, for romeo's banishment.take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,both you and i; for romeo is exiled:he made you for a highway to my bed;but i, a maid, die maiden-widowed.come, cords, come, nurse; i'll to my wedding-bed;and death, not romeo, take my maidenhead!nurse:hie to your chamber: i'll find romeoto comfort you: i wot well where he is.hark ye, your romeo will be here at night:i'll to him; he is hid at laurence' cell.juliet:o, find him! give this ring to my true knight,and bid him come to take his last farewell.friar laurence:romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,and thou art wedded to calamity.romeo:father, what news? what is the prince's doom?what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,that i yet know not?friar laurence:too familiaris my dear son with such sour company:i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.romeo:what less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?friar laurence:a gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,not body's death, but body's banishment.romeo:ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'for exile hath more terror in his look,much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'friar laurence:hence from verona art thou banished:be patient, for the world is broad and wide.romeo:there is no world without verona walls,but purgatory, torture, hell itself.hence-banished is banish'd from the world,and world's exile is death: then banished,is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,and smilest upon the stroke that murders me.friar laurence:o deadly sin! o rude unthankfulness!thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,and turn'd that black word death to banishment:this is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.romeo:'tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,where juliet lives; and every cat and dogand little mouse, every unworthy thing,live here in heaven and may look on her;but romeo may not: more validity,more honourable state, more courtship livesin carrion-flies than romeo: they my seizeon the white wonder of dear juliet's handand steal immortal blessing from her lips,who even in pure and vestal modesty,still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;but romeo may not; he is banished:flies may do this, but i from this must fly:they are free men, but i am banished.and say'st thou yet that exile is not death?hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,no sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,but 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?o friar, the damned use that word in hell;howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,being a divine, a ghostly confessor,a sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,to mangle me with that word 'banished'?friar laurence:thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.romeo:o, thou wilt speak again of banishment.friar laurence:i'll give thee armour to keep off that word:adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,to comfort thee, though thou art banished.romeo:yet 'banished'? hang up philosophy!unless philosophy can make a juliet,displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,it helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.friar laurence:o, then i see that madmen have no ears.romeo:how should they, when that wise men have no eyes?friar laurence:let me dispute with thee of thy estate.romeo:thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:wert thou as young as i, juliet thy love,an hour but married, tybalt murdered,doting like me and like me banished,then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,and fall upon the ground, as i do now,taking the measure of an unmade grave.friar laurence:arise; one knocks; good romeo, hide thyself.romeo:not i; unless the breath of heartsick groans,mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.friar laurence:hark, how they knock! who's there? romeo, arise;thou wilt be taken. stay awhile! stand up;run to my study. by and by! god's will,what simpleness is this! i come, i come!who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?nurse:friar laurence:welcome, then.nurse:o holy friar, o, tell me, holy friar,where is my lady's lord, where's romeo?friar laurence:there on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.nurse:o, he is even in my mistress' case,just in her case! o woful sympathy!piteous predicament! even so lies she,blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:for juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;why should you fall into so deep an o?romeo:nurse!nurse:ah sir! ah sir! well, death's the end of all.romeo:spakest thou of juliet? how is it with her?doth she not think me an old murderer,now i have stain'd the childhood of our joywith blood removed but little from her own?where is she? and how doth she? and what saysmy conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?nurse:o, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;and now falls on her bed; and then starts up,and tybalt calls; and then on romeo cries,and then down falls again.romeo:as if that name,shot from the deadly level of a gun,did murder her; as that name's cursed handmurder'd her kinsman. o, tell me, friar, tell me,in what vile part of this anatomydoth my name lodge? tell me, that i may sackthe hateful mansion.friar laurence:hold thy desperate hand:art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denotethe unreasonable fury of a beast:unseemly woman in a seeming man!or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,i thought thy disposition better temper'd.hast thou slain tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?and stay thy lady too that lives in thee,by doing damned hate upon thyself?why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meetin thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,and usest none in that true use indeedwhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:thy noble shape is but a form of wax,digressing from the valour of a man;thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,misshapen in the conduct of them both,like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,is set afire by thine own ignorance,and thou dismember'd with thine own defence.what, rouse thee, man! thy juliet is alive,for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;there art thou happy: tybalt would kill thee,but thou slew'st tybalt; there are thou happy too:the law that threaten'd death becomes thy friendand turns it to exile; there art thou happy:a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;happiness courts thee in her best array;but, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:but look thou stay not till the watch be set,for then thou canst not pass to mantua;where thou shalt live, till we can find a timeto blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,beg pardon of the prince, and call thee backwith twenty hundred thousand times more joythan thou went'st forth in lamentation.go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;and bid her hasten all the house to bed,which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:romeo is coming.nurse:o lord, i could have stay'd here all the nightto hear good counsel: o, what learning is!my lord, i'll tell my lady you will come.romeo:do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.nurse:here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.romeo:how well my comfort is revived by this!friar laurence:go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:either be gone before the watch be set,or by the break of day disguised from hence:sojourn in mantua; i'll find out your man,and he shall signify from time to timeevery good hap to you that chances here:give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.romeo:but that a joy past joy calls out on me,it were a grief, so brief to part with thee: farewell.capulet:things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,that we have had no time to move our daughter:look you, she loved her kinsman tybalt dearly,and so did i:--well, we were born to die.'tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:i promise you, but for your company,i would have been a-bed an hour ago.paris:these times of woe afford no time to woo.madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.lady capulet:i will, and know her mind early to-morrow;to-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.capulet:sir paris, i will make a desperate tenderof my child's love: i think she will be ruledin all respects by me; nay, more, i doubt it not.wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;acquaint her here of my son paris' love;and bid her, mark you me, on wednesday next--but, soft! what day is this?paris:monday, my lord,capulet:monday! ha, ha! well, wednesday is too soon,o' thursday let it be: o' thursday, tell her,she shall be married to this noble earl.will you be ready? do you like this haste?we'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;for, hark you, tybalt being slain so late,it may be thought we held him carelessly,being our kinsman, if we revel much:therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,and there an end. but what say you to thursday?paris:my lord, i would that thursday were to-morrow.capulet:well get you gone: o' thursday be it, then.go you to juliet ere you go to bed,prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.farewell, my lord. light to my chamber, ho!afore me! it is so very very late,that we may call it early by and by.good night.juliet:wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:it was the nightingale, and not the lark,that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:believe me, love, it was the nightingale.romeo:it was the lark, the herald of the morn,no nightingale: look, love, what envious streaksdo lace the severing clouds in yonder east:night's candles are burnt out, and jocund daystands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.i must be gone and live, or stay and die.juliet:yon light is not day-light, i know it, i:it is some meteor that the sun exhales,to be to thee this night a torch-bearer,and light thee on thy way to mantua:therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.romeo:let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;i am content, so thou wilt have it so.i'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow;nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beatthe vaulty heaven so high above our heads:i have more care to stay than will to go:come, death, and welcome! juliet wills it so.how is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.juliet:it is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!it is the lark that sings so out of tune,straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.some say the lark makes sweet division;this doth not so, for she divideth us:some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,o, now i would they had changed voices too!since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,o, now be gone; more light and light it grows.romeo:more light and light; more dark and dark our woes!nurse:madam!juliet:nurse?nurse:your lady mother is coming to your chamber:the day is broke; be wary, look about.juliet:then, window, let day in, and let life out.romeo:farewell, farewell! one kiss, and i'll descend.juliet:art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!i must hear from thee every day in the hour,for in a minute there are many days:o, by this count i shall be much in yearsere i again behold my romeo!romeo:farewell!i will omit no opportunitythat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.juliet:o think'st thou we shall ever meet again?romeo:i doubt it not; and all these woes shall servefor sweet discourses in our time to come.juliet:o god, i have an ill-divining soul!methinks i see thee, now thou art below,as one dead in the bottom of a tomb:either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.romeo:and trust me, love, in my eye so do you:dry sorrow drinks our blood. adieu, adieu!juliet:o fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:if thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.that is renown'd for faith? be fickle, fortune;for then, i hope, thou wilt not keep him long,but send him back.lady capulet:juliet:who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?is she not down so late, or up so early?what unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?lady capulet:why, how now, juliet!juliet:madam, i am not well.lady capulet:evermore weeping for your cousin's death?what, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?an if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;but much of grief shows still some want of wit.juliet:yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.lady capulet:so shall you feel the loss, but not the friendwhich you weep for.juliet:feeling so the loss,cannot choose but ever weep the friend.lady capulet:well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,as that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.juliet:what villain madam?lady capulet:that same villain, romeo.juliet:lady capulet:that is, because the traitor murderer lives.juliet:ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:would none but i might venge my cousin's death!lady capulet:we will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:then weep no more. i'll send to one in mantua,where that same banish'd runagate doth live,shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,that he shall soon keep tybalt company:and then, i hope, thou wilt be satisfied.juliet:indeed, i never shall be satisfiedwith romeo, till i behold him--dead--is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.madam, if you could find out but a manto bear a poison, i would temper it;that romeo should, upon receipt thereof,soon sleep in quiet. o, how my heart abhorsto hear him named, and cannot come to him.to wreak the love i bore my cousinupon his body that slaughter'd him!lady capulet:find thou the means, and i'll find such a man.but now i'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.juliet:and joy comes well in such a needy time:what are they, i beseech your ladyship?lady capulet:well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;one who, to put thee from thy heaviness,hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,that thou expect'st not nor i look'd not for.juliet:madam, in happy time, what day is that?lady capulet:marry, my child, early next thursday morn,the gallant, young and noble gentleman,the county paris, at saint peter's church,shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.juliet:now, by saint peter's church and peter too,he shall not make me there a joyful bride.i wonder at this haste; that i must wedere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.i pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,i will not marry yet; and, when i do, i swear,it shall be romeo, whom you know i hate,rather than paris. these are news indeed!lady capulet:here comes your father; tell him so yourself,and see how he will take it at your hands.capulet:when the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;but for the sunset of my brother's sonit rains downright.how now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?evermore showering? in one little bodythou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;for still thy eyes, which i may call the sea,do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,without a sudden calm, will oversetthy tempest-tossed body. how now, wife!have you deliver'd to her our decree?lady capulet:ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.i would the fool were married to her grave!capulet:soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.how! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,unworthy as she is, that we have wroughtso worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?juliet:not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:proud can i never be of what i hate;but thankful even for hate, that is meant love.capulet:how now, how now, chop-logic! what is this?'proud,' and 'i thank you,' and 'i thank you not;'and yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,but fettle your fine joints 'gainst thursday next,to go with paris to saint peter's church,or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither.out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!you tallow-face!lady capulet:fie, fie! what, are you mad?juliet:good father, i beseech you on my knees,hear me with patience but to speak a word.capulet:hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!i tell thee what: get thee to church o' thursday,or never after look me in the face:speak not, reply not, do not answer me;my fingers itch. wife, we scarce thought us blestthat god had lent us but this only child;but now i see this one is one too much,and that we have a curse in having her:out on her, hilding!nurse:god in heaven bless her!you are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.capulet:and why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.nurse:i speak no treason.capulet:o, god ye god-den.nurse:may not one speak?capulet:peace, you mumbling fool!utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;for here we need it not.lady capulet:you are too hot.capulet:god's bread! it makes me mad:day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,alone, in company, still my care hath beento have her match'd: and having now provideda gentleman of noble parentage,of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;and then to have a wretched puling fool,a whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,to answer 'i'll not wed; i cannot love,i am too young; i pray you, pardon me.'but, as you will not wed, i'll pardon you:graze where you will you shall not house with me:look to't, think on't, i do not use to jest.thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:an you be mine, i'll give you to my friend;and you be not, hang, beg, starve, die inthe streets,for, by my soul, i'll ne'er acknowledge thee,nor what is mine shall never do thee good:trust to't, bethink you; i'll not be forsworn.juliet:is there no pity sitting in the clouds,that sees into the bottom of my grief?o, sweet my mother, cast me not away!delay this marriage for a month, a week;or, if you do not, make the bridal bedin that dim monument where tybalt lies.lady capulet:talk not to me, for i'll not speak a word:do as thou wilt, for i have done with thee.juliet:o god!--o nurse, how shall this be prevented?my husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;how shall that faith return again to earth,unless that husband send it me from heavenby leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagemsupon so soft a subject as myself!what say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?some comfort, nurse.nurse:faith, here it is.romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.then, since the case so stands as now it doth,i think it best you married with the county.o, he's a lovely gentleman!romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eyeas paris hath. beshrew my very heart,i think you are happy in this second match,for it excels your first: or if it did not,your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,as living here and you no use of him.juliet:speakest thou from thy heart?nurse:and from my soul too;or else beshrew them both.juliet:amen!nurse:what?juliet:well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.go in: and tell my lady i am gone,having displeased my father, to laurence' cell,to make confession and to be absolved.nurse:marry, i will; and this is wisely done.juliet:ancient damnation! o most wicked fiend!is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,or to dispraise my lord with that same tonguewhich she hath praised him with above compareso many thousand times? go, counsellor;thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.i'll to the friar, to know his remedy:if all else fail, myself have power to die.friar laurence:on thursday, sir? the time is very short.paris:my father capulet will have it so;and i am nothing slow to slack his haste.friar laurence:you say you do not know the lady's mind:uneven is the course, i like it not.paris:immoderately she weeps for tybalt's death,and therefore have i little talk'd of love;for venus smiles not in a house of tears.now, sir, her father counts it dangerousthat she doth give her sorrow so much sway,and in his wisdom hastes our marriage,to stop the inundation of her tears;which, too much minded by herself alone,may be put from her by society:now do you know the reason of this haste.friar laurence:paris:happily met, my lady and my wife!juliet:that may be, sir, when i may be a wife.paris:that may be must be, love, on thursday next.juliet:what must be shall be.friar laurence:that's a certain text.paris:come you to make confession to this father?juliet:to answer that, i should confess to you.paris:do not deny to him that you love me.juliet:i will confess to you that i love him.paris:so will ye, i am sure, that you love me.juliet:if i do so, it will be of more price,being spoke behind your back, than to your face.paris:poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.juliet:the tears have got small victory by that;for it was bad enough before their spite.paris:thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.juliet:that is no slander, sir, which is a truth;and what i spake, i spake it to my face.paris:thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.juliet:it may be so, for it is not mine own.are you at leisure, holy father, now;or shall i come to you at evening mass?friar laurence:my leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.my lord, we must entreat the time alone.paris:god shield i should disturb devotion!juliet, on thursday early will i rouse ye:till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.juliet:o shut the door! and when thou hast done so,come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!friar laurence:ah, juliet, i already know thy grief;it strains me past the compass of my wits:i hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,on thursday next be married to this county.juliet:tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,unless thou tell me how i may prevent it:if, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,do thou but call my resolution wise,and with this knife i'll help it presently.god join'd my heart and romeo's, thou our hands;and ere this hand, by thee to romeo seal'd,shall be the label to another deed,or my true heart with treacherous revoltturn to another, this shall slay them both:therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,give me some present counsel, or, behold,'twixt my extremes and me this bloody knifeshall play the umpire, arbitrating thatwhich the commission of thy years and artcould to no issue of true honour bring.be not so long to speak; i long to die,if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.friar laurence:hold, daughter: i do spy a kind of hope,which craves as desperate an execution.as that is desperate which we would prevent.if, rather than to marry county paris,thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,then is it likely thou wilt undertakea thing like death to chide away this shame,that copest with death himself to scape from it:and, if thou darest, i'll give thee remedy.juliet:o, bid me leap, rather than marry paris,from off the battlements of yonder tower;or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurkwhere serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,o'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;or bid me go into a new-made graveand hide me with a dead man in his shroud;things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;and i will do it without fear or doubt,to live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.friar laurence:hold, then; go home, be merry, give consentto marry paris: wednesday is to-morrow:to-morrow night look that thou lie alone;let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:take thou this vial, being then in bed,and this distilled liquor drink thou off;when presently through all thy veins shall runa cold and drowsy humour, for no pulseshall keep his native progress, but surcease:no warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fadeto paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,like death, when he shuts up the day of life;each part, deprived of supple government,shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:and in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk deaththou shalt continue two and forty hours,and then awake as from a pleasant sleep.now, when the bridegroom in the morning comesto rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:then, as the manner of our country is,in thy best robes uncover'd on the bierthou shalt be borne to that same ancient vaultwhere all the kindred of the capulets lie.in the mean time, against thou shalt awake,shall romeo by my letters know our drift,and hither shall he come: and he and iwill watch thy waking, and that very nightshall romeo bear thee hence to mantua.and this shall free thee from this present shame;if no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,abate thy valour in the acting it.juliet:give me, give me! o, tell not me of fear!friar laurence:hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperousin this resolve: i'll send a friar with speedto mantua, with my letters to thy lord.juliet:love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.farewell, dear father!capulet:so many guests invite as here are writ.sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.second servant:you shall have none ill, sir; for i'll try if theycan lick their fingers.capulet:how canst thou try them so?second servant:marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick hisown fingers: therefore he that cannot lick hisfingers goes not with me.capulet:go, be gone.we shall be much unfurnished for this time.what, is my daughter gone to friar laurence?nurse:ay, forsooth.capulet:well, he may chance to do some good on her:a peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.nurse:see where she comes from shrift with merry look.capulet:how now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?juliet:where i have learn'd me to repent the sinof disobedient oppositionto you and your behests, and am enjoin'dby holy laurence to fall prostrate here,and beg your pardon: pardon, i beseech you!henceforward i am ever ruled by you.capulet:send for the county; go tell him of this:i'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.juliet:i met the youthful lord at laurence' cell;and gave him what becomed love i might,not step o'er the bounds of modesty.capulet:why, i am glad on't; this is well: stand up:this is as't should be. let me see the county;ay, marry, go, i say, and fetch him hither.now, afore god! this reverend holy friar,our whole city is much bound to him.juliet:nurse, will you go with me into my closet,to help me sort such needful ornamentsas you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?lady capulet:no, not till thursday; there is time enough.capulet:go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.lady  capulet:we shall be short in our provision:'tis now near night.capulet:tush, i will stir about,and all things shall be well, i warrant thee, wife:go thou to juliet, help to deck up her;i'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;i'll play the housewife for this once. what, ho!they are all forth. well, i will walk myselfto county paris, to prepare him upagainst to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.juliet:ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,i pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,for i have need of many orisonsto move the heavens to smile upon my state,which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.lady capulet:what, are you busy, ho? need you my help?juliet:no, madam; we have cull'd such necessariesas are behoveful for our state to-morrow:so please you, let me now be left alone,and let the nurse this night sit up with you;for, i am sure, you have your hands full all,in this so sudden business.lady capulet:good night:get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.juliet:farewell! god knows when we shall meet again.i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,that almost freezes up the heat of life:i'll call them back again to comfort me:nurse! what should she do here?my dismal scene i needs must act alone.come, vial.what if this mixture do not work at all?shall i be married then to-morrow morning?no, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.what if it be a poison, which the friarsubtly hath minister'd to have me dead,lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,because he married me before to romeo?i fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,for he hath still been tried a holy man.how if, when i am laid into the tomb,i wake before the time that romeocome to redeem me? there's a fearful point!shall i not, then, be stifled in the vault,to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,and there die strangled ere my romeo comes?or, if i live, is it not very like,the horrible conceit of death and night,together with the terror of the place,--as in a vault, an ancient receptacle,where, for these many hundred years, the bonesof all my buried ancestors are packed:where bloody tybalt, yet but green in earth,lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,at some hours in the night spirits resort;--alack, alack, is it not like that i,so early waking, what with loathsome smells,and shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,that living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--o, if i wake, shall i not be distraught,environed with all these hideous fears?and madly play with my forefather's joints?and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud?and, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,as with a club, dash out my desperate brains?o, look! methinks i see my cousin's ghostseeking out romeo, that did spit his bodyupon a rapier's point: stay, tybalt, stay!romeo, i come! this do i drink to thee.lady capulet:hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.nurse:they call for dates and quinces in the pastry.capulet:come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,the curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:look to the baked meats, good angelica:spare not for the cost.nurse:go, you cot-quean, go,get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick to-morrowfor this night's watching.capulet:no, not a whit: what! i have watch'd ere nowall night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.lady capulet:ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;but i will watch you from such watching now.capulet:a jealous hood, a jealous hood!now, fellow,what's there?first servant:things for the cook, sir; but i know not what.capulet:make haste, make haste.sirrah, fetch drier logs:call peter, he will show thee where they are.second servant:i have a head, sir, that will find out logs,and never trouble peter for the matter.capulet:mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!thou shalt be logger-head. good faith, 'tis day:the county will be here with music straight,for so he said he would: i hear him near.nurse! wife! what, ho! what, nurse, i say!go waken juliet, go and trim her up;i'll go and chat with paris: hie, make haste,make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:make haste, i say.nurse:mistress! what, mistress! juliet! fast, i warrant her, she:why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!why, love, i say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!what, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;sleep for a week; for the next night, i warrant,the county paris hath set up his rest,that you shall rest but little. god forgive me,marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!i must needs wake her. madam, madam, madam!ay, let the county take you in your bed;he'll fright you up, i' faith. will it not be?what, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!i must needs wake you; lady! lady! lady!alas, alas! help, help! my lady's dead!o, well-a-day, that ever i was born!some aqua vitae, ho! my lord! my lady!lady capulet:what noise is here?nurse:o lamentable day!lady capulet:what is the matter?nurse:look, look! o heavy day!lady capulet:o me, o me! my child, my only life,revive, look up, or i will die with thee!help, help! call help.capulet:for shame, bring juliet forth; her lord is come.nurse:she's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!lady capulet:alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!capulet:ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;life and these lips have long been separated:death lies on her like an untimely frostupon the sweetest flower of all the field.nurse:o lamentable day!lady capulet:o woful time!capulet:death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.friar laurence:come, is the bride ready to go to church?capulet:ready to go, but never to return.o son! the night before thy wedding-dayhath death lain with thy wife. there she lies,flower as she was, deflowered by him.death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;my daughter he hath wedded: i will die,and leave him all; life, living, all is death's.paris:have i thought long to see this morning's face,and doth it give me such a sight as this?lady capulet:accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!most miserable hour that e'er time sawin lasting labour of his pilgrimage!but one, poor one, one poor and loving child,but one thing to rejoice and solace in,and cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!nurse:o woe! o woful, woful, woful day!most lamentable day, most woful day,that ever, ever, i did yet behold!o day! o day! o day! o hateful day!never was seen so black a day as this:o woful day, o woful day!paris:beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,by cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!o love! o life! not life, but love in death!capulet:despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!uncomfortable time, why camest thou nowto murder, murder our solemnity?o child! o child! my soul, and not my child!dead art thou! alack! my child is dead;and with my child my joys are buried.friar laurence:peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives notin these confusions. heaven and yourselfhad part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,and all the better is it for the maid:your part in her you could not keep from death,but heaven keeps his part in eternal life.the most you sought was her promotion;for 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:and weep ye now, seeing she is advancedabove the clouds, as high as heaven itself?o, in this love, you love your child so ill,that you run mad, seeing that she is well:she's not well married that lives married long;but she's best married that dies married young.dry up your tears, and stick your rosemaryon this fair corse; and, as the custom is,in all her best array bear her to church:for though fond nature bids us an lament,yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.capulet:all things that we ordained festival,turn from their office to black funeral;our instruments to melancholy bells,our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,and all things change them to the contrary.friar laurence:sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;and go, sir paris; every one prepareto follow this fair corse unto her grave:the heavens do lour upon you for some ill;move them no more by crossing their high will.first musician:faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.nurse:honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;for, well you know, this is a pitiful case.first musician:ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.peter:musicians, o, musicians, 'heart's ease, heart'sease:' o, an you will have me live, play 'heart's ease.'first musician:why 'heart's ease?'peter:o, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'myheart is full of woe:' o, play me some merry dump,to comfort me.first musician:not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.peter:you will not, then?first musician:no.peter:i will then give it you soundly.first musician:what will you give us?peter:no money, on my faith, but the gleek;i will give you the minstrel.first musician:then i will give you the serving-creature.peter:then will i lay the serving-creature's dagger onyour pate. i will carry no crotchets: i'll re you,i'll fa you; do you note me?first musician:an you re us and fa us, you note us.second musician:pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.peter:then have at you with my wit! i will dry-beat youwith an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. answerme like men:'when griping grief the heart doth wound,and doleful dumps the mind oppress,then music with her silver sound'--why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silversound'? what say you, simon catling?musician:marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.peter:pretty! what say you, hugh rebeck?second musician:i say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.peter:pretty too! what say you, james soundpost?third musician:faith, i know not what to say.peter:o, i cry you mercy; you are the singer: i will sayfor you. it is 'music with her silver sound,'because musicians have no gold for sounding:'then music with her silver soundwith speedy help doth lend redress.'first musician:what a pestilent knave is this same!second musician:hang him, jack! come, we'll in here; tarry for themourners, and stay dinner.romeo:if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep,my dreams presage some joyful news at hand:my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;and all this day an unaccustom'd spiritlifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.i dreamt my lady came and found me dead--strange dream, that gives a dead man leaveto think!--and breathed such life with kisses in my lips,that i revived, and was an emperor.ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,when but love's shadows are so rich in joy!news from verona!--how now, balthasar!dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?how doth my lady? is my father well?how fares my juliet? that i ask again;for nothing can be ill, if she be well.balthasar:then she is well, and nothing can be ill:her body sleeps in capel's monument,and her immortal part with angels lives.i saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,and presently took post to tell it you:o, pardon me for bringing these ill news,since you did leave it for my office, sir.romeo:is it even so? then i defy you, stars!thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,and hire post-horses; i will hence to-night.balthasar:i do beseech you, sir, have patience:your looks are pale and wild, and do importsome misadventure.romeo:tush, thou art deceived:leave me, and do the thing i bid thee do.hast thou no letters to me from the friar?balthasar:no, my good lord.romeo:no matter: get thee gone,and hire those horses; i'll be with thee straight.well, juliet, i will lie with thee to-night.let's see for means: o mischief, thou art swiftto enter in the thoughts of desperate men!i do remember an apothecary,--and hereabouts he dwells,--which late i notedin tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,culling of simples; meagre were his looks,sharp misery had worn him to the bones:and in his needy shop a tortoise hung,an alligator stuff'd, and other skinsof ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelvesa beggarly account of empty boxes,green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.noting this penury, to myself i said'an if a man did need a poison now,whose sale is present death in mantua,here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'o, this same thought did but forerun my need;and this same needy man must sell it me.as i remember, this should be the house.being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.what, ho! apothecary!apothecary:who calls so loud?romeo:come hither, man. i see that thou art poor:hold, there is forty ducats: let me havea dram of poison, such soon-speeding gearas will disperse itself through all the veinsthat the life-weary taker may fall deadand that the trunk may be discharged of breathas violently as hasty powder fireddoth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.apothecary:such mortal drugs i have; but mantua's lawis death to any he that utters them.romeo:art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,and fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;the world is not thy friend nor the world's law;the world affords no law to make thee rich;then be not poor, but break it, and take this.apothecary:my poverty, but not my will, consents.romeo:i pay thy poverty, and not thy will.apothecary:put this in any liquid thing you will,and drink it off; and, if you had the strengthof twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.romeo:there is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,doing more murders in this loathsome world,than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.i sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.come, cordial and not poison, go with meto juliet's grave; for there must i use thee.friar john:holy franciscan friar! brother, ho!friar laurence:this same should be the voice of friar john.welcome from mantua: what says romeo?or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.friar john:going to find a bare-foot brother outone of our order, to associate me,here in this city visiting the sick,and finding him, the searchers of the town,suspecting that we both were in a housewhere the infectious pestilence did reign,seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;so that my speed to mantua there was stay'd.friar laurence:who bare my letter, then, to romeo?friar john:i could not send it,--here it is again,--nor get a messenger to bring it thee,so fearful were they of infection.friar laurence:unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,the letter was not nice but full of chargeof dear import, and the neglecting itmay do much danger. friar john, go hence;get me an iron crow, and bring it straightunto my cell.friar john:brother, i'll go and bring it thee.friar laurence:now must i to the monument alone;within three hours will fair juliet wake:she will beshrew me much that romeohath had no notice of these accidents;but i will write again to mantua,and keep her at my cell till romeo come;poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!paris:give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:yet put it out, for i would not be seen.under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,but thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,as signal that thou hear'st something approach.give me those flowers. do as i bid thee, go.page:paris:sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed i strew,--o woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--which with sweet water nightly i will dew,or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:the obsequies that i for thee will keepnightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.the boy gives warning something doth approach.what cursed foot wanders this way to-night,to cross my obsequies and true love's rite?what with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.romeo:give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.hold, take this letter; early in the morningsee thou deliver it to my lord and father.give me the light: upon thy life, i charge thee,whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,and do not interrupt me in my course.why i descend into this bed of death,is partly to behold my lady's face;but chiefly to take thence from her dead fingera precious ring, a ring that i must usein dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:but if thou, jealous, dost return to pryin what i further shall intend to do,by heaven, i will tear thee joint by jointand strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:the time and my intents are savage-wild,more fierce and more inexorable farthan empty tigers or the roaring sea.balthasar:i will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.romeo:so shalt thou show me friendship. take thou that:live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.balthasar:romeo:thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open,and, in despite, i'll cram thee with more food!paris:this is that banish'd haughty montague,that murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,it is supposed, the fair creature died;and here is come to do some villanous shameto the dead bodies: i will apprehend him.stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile montague!can vengeance be pursued further than death?condemned villain, i do apprehend thee:obey, and go with me; for thou must die.romeo:i must indeed; and therefore came i hither.good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;let them affright thee. i beseech thee, youth,put not another sin upon my head,by urging me to fury: o, be gone!by heaven, i love thee better than myself;for i come hither arm'd against myself:stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,a madman's mercy bade thee run away.paris:i do defy thy conjurations,and apprehend thee for a felon here.romeo:wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!page:o lord, they fight! i will go call the watch.paris:o, i am slain!if thou be merciful,open the tomb, lay me with juliet.romeo:in faith, i will. let me peruse this face.mercutio's kinsman, noble county paris!what said my man, when my betossed souldid not attend him as we rode? i thinkhe told me paris should have married juliet:said he not so? or did i dream it so?or am i mad, hearing him talk of juliet,to think it was so? o, give me thy hand,one writ with me in sour misfortune's book!i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;a grave? o no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,for here lies juliet, and her beauty makesthis vault a feasting presence full of light.death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.how oft when men are at the point of deathhave they been merry! which their keepers calla lightning before death: o, how may icall this a lightning? o my love! my wife!death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yetis crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,and death's pale flag is not advanced there.tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?o, what more favour can i do to thee,than with that hand that cut thy youth in twainto sunder his that was thine enemy?forgive me, cousin! ah, dear juliet,why art thou yet so fair? shall i believethat unsubstantial death is amorous,and that the lean abhorred monster keepsthee here in dark to be his paramour?for fear of that, i still will stay with thee;and never from this palace of dim nightdepart again: here, here will i remainwith worms that are thy chamber-maids; o, herewill i set up my everlasting rest,and shake the yoke of inauspicious starsfrom this world-wearied flesh. eyes, look your last!arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, o youthe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kissa dateless bargain to engrossing death!come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!thou desperate pilot, now at once run onthe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!here's to my love!o true apothecary!thy drugs are quick. thus with a kiss i die.friar laurence:saint francis be my speed! how oft to-nighthave my old feet stumbled at graves! who's there?balthasar:here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.friar laurence:bliss be upon you! tell me, good my friend,what torch is yond, that vainly lends his lightto grubs and eyeless skulls? as i discern,it burneth in the capel's monument.balthasar:it doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,one that you love.friar laurence:who is it?balthasar:romeo.friar laurence:how long hath he been there?balthasar:full half an hour.friar laurence:go with me to the vault.balthasar:i dare not, sirmy master knows not but i am gone hence;and fearfully did menace me with death,if i did stay to look on his intents.friar laurence:stay, then; i'll go alone. fear comes upon me:o, much i fear some ill unlucky thing.balthasar:as i did sleep under this yew-tree here,i dreamt my master and another fought,and that my master slew him.friar laurence:romeo!alack, alack, what blood is this, which stainsthe stony entrance of this sepulchre?what mean these masterless and gory swordsto lie discolour'd by this place of peace?romeo! o, pale! who else? what, paris too?and steep'd in blood? ah, what an unkind houris guilty of this lamentable chance!the lady stirs.juliet:o comfortable friar! where is my lord?i do remember well where i should be,and there i am. where is my romeo?friar laurence:i hear some noise. lady, come from that nestof death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:a greater power than we can contradicthath thwarted our intents. come, come away.thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;and paris too. come, i'll dispose of theeamong a sisterhood of holy nuns:stay not to question, for the watch is coming;come, go, good juliet,i dare no longer stay.juliet:go, get thee hence, for i will not away.what's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?poison, i see, hath been his timeless end:o churl! drunk all, and left no friendly dropto help me after? i will kiss thy lips;haply some poison yet doth hang on them,to make die with a restorative.thy lips are warm.first watchman:juliet:yea, noise? then i'll be brief. o happy dagger!this is thy sheath;there rust, and let me die.page:this is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.first watchman:the ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,and juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,who here hath lain these two days buried.go, tell the prince: run to the capulets:raise up the montagues: some others search:we see the ground whereon these woes do lie;but the true ground of all these piteous woeswe cannot without circumstance descry.second watchman:here's romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.first watchman:hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.third watchman:here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:we took this mattock and this spade from him,as he was coming from this churchyard side.first watchman:a great suspicion: stay the friar too.prince:what misadventure is so early up,that calls our person from our morning's rest?capulet:what should it be, that they so shriek abroad?lady capulet:the people in the street cry romeo,some juliet, and some paris; and all run,with open outcry toward our monument.prince:what fear is this which startles in our ears?first watchman:sovereign, here lies the county paris slain;and romeo dead; and juliet, dead before,warm and new kill'd.prince:search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.first watchman:here is a friar, and slaughter'd romeo's man;with instruments upon them, fit to openthese dead men's tombs.capulet:o heavens! o wife, look how our daughter bleeds!this dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his houseis empty on the back of montague,--and it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!lady capulet:o me! this sight of death is as a bell,that warns my old age to a sepulchre.prince:come, montague; for thou art early up,to see thy son and heir more early down.montague:alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:what further woe conspires against mine age?prince:look, and thou shalt see.montague:o thou untaught! what manners is in this?to press before thy father to a grave?prince:seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,till we can clear these ambiguities,and know their spring, their head, theirtrue descent;and then will i be general of your woes,and lead you even to death: meantime forbear,and let mischance be slave to patience.bring forth the parties of suspicion.friar laurence:i am the greatest, able to do least,yet most suspected, as the time and placedoth make against me of this direful murder;and here i stand, both to impeach and purgemyself condemned and myself excused.prince:then say at once what thou dost know in this.friar laurence:i will be brief, for my short date of breathis not so long as is a tedious tale.romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet;and she, there dead, that romeo's faithful wife:i married them; and their stol'n marriage-daywas tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely deathbanish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pined.you, to remove that siege of grief from her,betroth'd and would have married her perforceto county paris: then comes she to me,and, with wild looks, bid me devise some meanto rid her from this second marriage,or in my cell there would she kill herself.then gave i her, so tutor'd by my art,a sleeping potion; which so took effectas i intended, for it wrought on herthe form of death: meantime i writ to romeo,that he should hither come as this dire night,to help to take her from her borrow'd grave,being the time the potion's force should cease.but he which bore my letter, friar john,was stay'd by accident, and yesternightreturn'd my letter back. then all aloneat the prefixed hour of her waking,came i to take her from her kindred's vault;meaning to keep her closely at my cell,till i conveniently could send to romeo:but when i came, some minute ere the timeof her awaking, here untimely laythe noble paris and true romeo dead.she wakes; and i entreated her come forth,and bear this work of heaven with patience:but then a noise did scare me from the tomb;and she, too desperate, would not go with me,but, as it seems, did violence on herself.all this i know; and to the marriageher nurse is privy: and, if aught in thismiscarried by my fault, let my old lifebe sacrificed, some hour before his time,unto the rigour of severest law.prince:we still have known thee for a holy man.where's romeo's man? what can he say in this?balthasar:i brought my master news of juliet's death;and then in post he came from mantuato this same place, to this same monument.this letter he early bid me give his father,and threatened me with death, going in the vault,i departed not and left him there.prince:give me the letter; i will look on it.where is the county's page, that raised the watch?sirrah, what made your master in this place?page:he came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;and bid me stand aloof, and so i did:anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;and by and by my master drew on him;and then i ran away to call the watch.prince:this letter doth make good the friar's words,their course of love, the tidings of her death:and here he writes that he did buy a poisonof a poor 'pothecary, and therewithalcame to this vault to die, and lie with juliet.where be these enemies? capulet! montague!see, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.and i for winking at your discords toohave lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.capulet:o brother montague, give me thy hand:this is my daughter's jointure, for no morecan i demand.montague:but i can give thee more:for i will raise her statue in pure gold;that while verona by that name is known,there shall no figure at such rate be setas that of true and faithful juliet.capulet:as rich shall romeo's by his lady's lie;poor sacrifices of our enmity!prince:a glooming peace this morning with it brings;the sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:for never was a story of more woethan this of juliet and her romeo.warwick:i wonder how the king escaped our hands.york:while we pursued the horsemen of the north,he slily stole away and left his men:whereat the great lord of northumberland,whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,lord clifford and lord stafford, all abreast,charged our main battle's front, and breaking inwere by the swords of common soldiers slain.edward:lord stafford's father, duke of buckingham,is either slain or wounded dangerously;i cleft his beaver with a downright blow:that this is true, father, behold his blood.montague:and, brother, here's the earl of wiltshire's blood,whom i encounter'd as the battles join'd.richard:speak thou for me and tell them what i did.york:richard hath best deserved of all my sons.but is your grace dead, my lord of somerset?norfolk:such hope have all the line of john of gaunt!richard:thus do i hope to shake king henry's head.warwick:and so do i. victorious prince of york,before i see thee seated in that thronewhich now the house of lancaster usurps,i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.this is the palace of the fearful king,and this the regal seat: possess it, york;for this is thine and not king henry's heirs'york:assist me, then, sweet warwick, and i will;for hither we have broken in by force.norfolk:we'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.york:thanks, gentle norfolk: stay by me, my lords;and, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.warwick:and when the king comes, offer no violence,unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.york:the queen this day here holds her parliament,but little thinks we shall be of her council:by words or blows here let us win our right.richard:arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.warwick:the bloody parliament shall this be call'd,unless plantagenet, duke of york, be king,and bashful henry deposed, whose cowardicehath made us by-words to our enemies.york:then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;i mean to take possession of my right.warwick:neither the king, nor he that loves him best,the proudest he that holds up lancaster,dares stir a wing, if warwick shake his bells.i'll plant plantagenet, root him up who dares:resolve thee, richard; claim the english crown.king henry vi:my lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,even in the chair of state: belike he means,back'd by the power of warwick, that false peer,to aspire unto the crown and reign as king.earl of northumberland, he slew thy father.and thine, lord clifford; and you both have vow'd revengeon him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.northumberland:if i be not, heavens be revenged on me!clifford:the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel.westmoreland:what, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:my heart for anger burns; i cannot brook it.king henry vi:be patient, gentle earl of westmoreland.clifford:patience is for poltroons, such as he:he durst not sit there, had your father lived.my gracious lord, here in the parliamentlet us assail the family of york.northumberland:well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.king henry vi:ah, know you not the city favours them,and they have troops of soldiers at their beck?exeter:but when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.king henry vi:far be the thought of this from henry's heart,to make a shambles of the parliament-house!cousin of exeter, frowns, words and threatsshall be the war that henry means to use.thou factious duke of york, descend my throne,and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;i am thy sovereign.york:i am thine.exeter:for shame, come down: he made thee duke of york.york:'twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.exeter:thy father was a traitor to the crown.warwick:exeter, thou art a traitor to the crownin following this usurping henry.clifford:whom should he follow but his natural king?warwick:true, clifford; and that's richard duke of york.king henry vi:and shall i stand, and thou sit in my throne?york:it must and shall be so: content thyself.warwick:be duke of lancaster; let him be king.westmoreland:he is both king and duke of lancaster;and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain.warwick:and warwick shall disprove it. you forgetthat we are those which chased you from the fieldand slew your fathers, and with colours spreadmarch'd through the city to the palace gates.northumberland:yes, warwick, i remember it to my grief;and, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.westmoreland:plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,thy kinsman and thy friends, i'll have more livesthan drops of blood were in my father's veins.clifford:urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,i send thee, warwick, such a messengeras shall revenge his death before i stir.warwick:poor clifford! how i scorn his worthless threats!york:will you we show our title to the crown?if not, our swords shall plead it in the field.king henry vi:what title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?thy father was, as thou art, duke of york;thy grandfather, roger mortimer, earl of march:i am the son of henry the fifth,who made the dauphin and the french to stoopand seized upon their towns and provinces.warwick:talk not of france, sith thou hast lost it all.king henry vi:the lord protector lost it, and not i:when i was crown'd i was but nine months old.richard:you are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.edward:sweet father, do so; set it on your head.montague:good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.richard:sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.york:sons, peace!king henry vi:peace, thou! and give king henry leave to speak.warwick:plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;and be you silent and attentive too,for he that interrupts him shall not live.king henry vi:think'st thou that i will leave my kingly throne,wherein my grandsire and my father sat?no: first shall war unpeople this my realm;ay, and their colours, often borne in france,and now in england to our heart's great sorrow,shall be my winding-sheet. why faint you, lords?my title's good, and better far than his.warwick:prove it, henry, and thou shalt be king.king henry vi:henry the fourth by conquest got the crown.york:'twas by rebellion against his king.king henry vi:york:what then?king henry vi:an if he may, then am i lawful king;for richard, in the view of many lords,resign'd the crown to henry the fourth,whose heir my father was, and i am his.york:he rose against him, being his sovereign,and made him to resign his crown perforce.warwick:suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?exeter:no; for he could not so resign his crownbut that the next heir should succeed and reign.king henry vi:art thou against us, duke of exeter?exeter:his is the right, and therefore pardon me.york:why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?exeter:my conscience tells me he is lawful king.king henry vi:northumberland:plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,think not that henry shall be so deposed.warwick:deposed he shall be, in despite of all.northumberland:thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,of essex, norfolk, suffolk, nor of kent,which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,can set the duke up in despite of me.clifford:king henry, be thy title right or wrong,lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence:may that ground gape and swallow me alive,where i shall kneel to him that slew my father!king henry vi:o clifford, how thy words revive my heart!york:henry of lancaster, resign thy crown.what mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?warwick:do right unto this princely duke of york,or i will fill the house with armed men,and over the chair of state, where now he sits,write up his title with usurping blood.king henry vi:my lord of warwick, hear me but one word:let me for this my life-time reign as king.york:confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.king henry vi:i am content: richard plantagenet,enjoy the kingdom after my decease.clifford:what wrong is this unto the prince your son!warwick:what good is this to england and himself!westmoreland:base, fearful and despairing henry!clifford:how hast thou injured both thyself and us!westmoreland:i cannot stay to hear these articles.northumberland:nor i.clifford:come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.westmoreland:farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.northumberland:be thou a prey unto the house of york,and die in bands for this unmanly deed!clifford:in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,or live in peace abandon'd and despised!warwick:turn this way, henry, and regard them not.exeter:they seek revenge and therefore will not yield.king henry vi:ah, exeter!warwick:why should you sigh, my lord?king henry vi:not for myself, lord warwick, but my son,whom i unnaturally shall disinherit.but be it as it may: i here entailthe crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;conditionally, that here thou take an oathto cease this civil war, and, whilst i live,to honour me as thy king and sovereign,and neither by treason nor hostilityto seek to put me down and reign thyself.york:this oath i willingly take and will perform.warwick:long live king henry! plantagenet embrace him.king henry vi:and long live thou and these thy forward sons!york:now york and lancaster are reconciled.exeter:accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!york:farewell, my gracious lord; i'll to my castle.warwick:and i'll keep london with my soldiers.norfolk:and i to norfolk with my followers.montague:and i unto the sea from whence i came.king henry vi:and i, with grief and sorrow, to the court.exeter:here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:i'll steal away.king henry vi:exeter, so will i.queen margaret:nay, go not from me; i will follow thee.king henry vi:be patient, gentle queen, and i will stay.queen margaret:who can be patient in such extremes?ah, wretched man! would i had died a maidand never seen thee, never borne thee son,seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a fatherhath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?hadst thou but loved him half so well as i,or felt that pain which i did for him once,or nourish'd him as i did with my blood,thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,rather than have that savage duke thine heirand disinherited thine only son.prince edward:father, you cannot disinherit me:if you be king, why should not i succeed?king henry vi:pardon me, margaret; pardon me, sweet son:the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me.queen margaret:enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?i shame to hear thee speak. ah, timorous wretch!thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;and given unto the house of york such headas thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.to entail him and his heirs unto the crown,what is it, but to make thy sepulchreand creep into it far before thy time?warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais;stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas;the duke is made protector of the realm;and yet shalt thou be safe? such safety findsthe trembling lamb environed with wolves.had i been there, which am a silly woman,the soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikesbefore i would have granted to that act.but thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:and seeing thou dost, i here divorce myselfboth from thy table, henry, and thy bed,until that act of parliament be repeal'dwhereby my son is disinherited.the northern lords that have forsworn thy colourswill follow mine, if once they see them spread;and spread they shall be, to thy foul disgraceand utter ruin of the house of york.thus do i leave thee. come, son, let's away;our army is ready; come, we'll after them.king henry vi:stay, gentle margaret, and hear me speak.queen margaret:thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.king henry vi:gentle son edward, thou wilt stay with me?queen margaret:ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.prince edward:when i return with victory from the fieldi'll see your grace: till then i'll follow her.queen margaret:come, son, away; we may not linger thus.king henry vi:poor queen! how love to me and to her sonhath made her break out into terms of rage!revenged may she be on that hateful duke,whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,will cost my crown, and like an empty eagletire on the flesh of me and of my son!the loss of those three lords torments my heart:i'll write unto them and entreat them fair.come, cousin you shall be the messenger.exeter:and i, i hope, shall reconcile them all.3 king henry virichard:brother, though i be youngest, give me leave.edward:no, i can better play the orator.montague:but i have reasons strong and forcible.york:why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?what is your quarrel? how began it first?edward:no quarrel, but a slight contention.york:about what?richard:about that which concerns your grace and us;the crown of england, father, which is yours.york:mine boy? not till king henry be dead.richard:your right depends not on his life or death.edward:now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe,it will outrun you, father, in the end.york:i took an oath that he should quietly reign.edward:but for a kingdom any oath may be broken:i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.richard:no; god forbid your grace should be forsworn.york:i shall be, if i claim by open war.richard:i'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.york:thou canst not, son; it is impossible.richard:an oath is of no moment, being not tookbefore a true and lawful magistrate,that hath authority over him that swears:henry had none, but did usurp the place;then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.therefore, to arms! and, father, do but thinkhow sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;within whose circuit is elysiumand all that poets feign of bliss and joy.why do we finger thus? i cannot restuntil the white rose that i wear be dyedeven in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart.york:richard, enough; i will be king, or die.brother, thou shalt to london presently,and whet on warwick to this enterprise.thou, richard, shalt to the duke of norfolk,and tell him privily of our intent.you edward, shall unto my lord cobham,with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise:in them i trust; for they are soldiers,witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.while you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,but that i seek occasion how to rise,and yet the king not privy to my drift,nor any of the house of lancaster?but, stay: what news? why comest thou in such post?messenger:the queen with all the northern earls and lordsintend here to besiege you in your castle:she is hard by with twenty thousand men;and therefore fortify your hold, my lord.york:ay, with my sword. what! think'st thou that we fear them?edward and richard, you shall stay with me;my brother montague shall post to london:let noble warwick, cobham, and the rest,whom we have left protectors of the king,with powerful policy strengthen themselves,and trust not simple henry nor his oaths.montague:brother, i go; i'll win them, fear it not:and thus most humbly i do take my leave.sir john and sir hugh mortimer, mine uncles,you are come to sandal in a happy hour;the army of the queen mean to besiege us.john mortimer:she shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.york:what, with five thousand men?richard:ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:a woman's general; what should we fear?edward:i hear their drums: let's set our men in order,and issue forth and bid them battle straight.york:five men to twenty! though the odds be great,i doubt not, uncle, of our victory.many a battle have i won in france,when as the enemy hath been ten to one:why should i not now have the like success?3 king henry virutland:ah, whither shall i fly to 'scape their hands?ah, tutor, look where bloody clifford comes!clifford:chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.as for the brat of this accursed duke,whose father slew my father, he shall die.tutor:and i, my lord, will bear him company.clifford:soldiers, away with him!tutor:ah, clifford, murder not this innocent child,lest thou be hated both of god and man!clifford:how now! is he dead already? or is it fearthat makes him close his eyes? i'll open them.rutland:so looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretchthat trembles under his devouring paws;and so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,and so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.ah, gentle clifford, kill me with thy sword,and not with such a cruel threatening look.sweet clifford, hear me speak before i die.i am too mean a subject for thy wrath:be thou revenged on men, and let me live.clifford:in vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's bloodhath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.rutland:then let my father's blood open it again:he is a man, and, clifford, cope with him.clifford:had thy brethren here, their lives and thinewere not revenge sufficient for me;no, if i digg'd up thy forefathers' gravesand hung their rotten coffins up in chains,it could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.the sight of any of the house of yorkis as a fury to torment my soul;and till i root out their accursed lineand leave not one alive, i live in hell.therefore--rutland:o, let me pray before i take my death!to thee i pray; sweet clifford, pity me!clifford:such pity as my rapier's point affords.rutland:i never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?clifford:thy father hath.rutland:but 'twas ere i was born.thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,lest in revenge thereof, sith god is just,he be as miserably slain as i.ah, let me live in prison all my days;and when i give occasion of offence,then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.clifford:no cause!thy father slew my father; therefore, die.rutland:di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!clifford:plantagenet! i come, plantagenet!and this thy son's blood cleaving to my bladeshall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.3 king henry viyork:the army of the queen hath got the field:my uncles both are slain in rescuing me;and all my followers to the eager foeturn back and fly, like ships before the windor lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.my sons, god knows what hath bechanced them:but this i know, they have demean'd themselveslike men born to renown by life or death.three times did richard make a lane to me.and thrice cried 'courage, father! fight it out!'and full as oft came edward to my side,with purple falchion, painted to the hiltin blood of those that had encounter'd him:and when the hardiest warriors did retire,richard cried 'charge! and give no foot of ground!'and cried 'a crown, or else a glorious tomb!a sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'with this, we charged again: but, out, alas!we bodged again; as i have seen a swanwith bootless labour swim against the tideand spend her strength with over-matching waves.ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;and i am faint and cannot fly their fury:and were i strong, i would not shun their fury:the sands are number'd that make up my life;here must i stay, and here my life must end.come, bloody clifford, rough northumberland,i dare your quenchless fury to more rage:i am your butt, and i abide your shot.northumberland:yield to our mercy, proud plantagenet.clifford:ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,with downright payment, show'd unto my father.now phaethon hath tumbled from his car,and made an evening at the noontide prick.york:my ashes, as the phoenix, may bring fortha bird that will revenge upon you all:and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven,scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?clifford:so cowards fight when they can fly no further;so doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;so desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.york:o clifford, but bethink thee once again,and in thy thought o'er-run my former time;and, if though canst for blushing, view this face,and bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardicewhose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!clifford:i will not bandy with thee word for word,but buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.queen margaret:hold, valiant clifford! for a thousand causesi would prolong awhile the traitor's life.wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, northumberland.northumberland:hold, clifford! do not honour him so muchto prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:what valour were it, when a cur doth grin,for one to thrust his hand between his teeth,when he might spurn him with his foot away?it is war's prize to take all vantages;and ten to one is no impeach of valour.clifford:ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.northumberland:so doth the cony struggle in the net.york:so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;so true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.northumberland:what would your grace have done unto him now?queen margaret:brave warriors, clifford and northumberland,come, make him stand upon this molehill here,that raught at mountains with outstretched arms,yet parted but the shadow with his hand.what! was it you that would be england's king?was't you that revell'd in our parliament,and made a preachment of your high descent?where are your mess of sons to back you now?the wanton edward, and the lusty george?and where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voicewas wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?or, with the rest, where is your darling rutland?look, york: i stain'd this napkin with the bloodthat valiant clifford, with his rapier's point,made issue from the bosom of the boy;and if thine eyes can water for his death,i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.alas poor york! but that i hate thee deadly,i should lament thy miserable state.i prithee, grieve, to make me merry, york.what, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrailsthat not a tear can fall for rutland's death?why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;and i, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.stamp, rave, and fret, that i may sing and dance.thou wouldst be fee'd, i see, to make me sport:york cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.a crown for york! and, lords, bow low to him:hold you his hands, whilst i do set it on.ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!ay, this is he that took king henry's chair,and this is he was his adopted heir.but how is it that great plantagenetis crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?as i bethink me, you should not be kingtill our king henry had shook hands with death.and will you pale your head in henry's glory,and rob his temples of the diadem,now in his life, against your holy oath?o, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!off with the crown, and with the crown his head;and, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.clifford:that is my office, for my father's sake.queen margaret:nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.york:she-wolf of france, but worse than wolves of france,whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!how ill-beseeming is it in thy sexto triumph, like an amazonian trull,upon their woes whom fortune captivates!but that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,made impudent with use of evil deeds,i would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.to tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.thy father bears the type of king of naples,of both the sicils and jerusalem,yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman.hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?it needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,unless the adage must be verified,that beggars mounted run their horse to death.'tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;but, god he knows, thy share thereof is small:'tis virtue that doth make them most admired;the contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:'tis government that makes them seem divine;the want thereof makes thee abominable:thou art as opposite to every goodas the antipodes are unto us,or as the south to the septentrion.o tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!how couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,to bid the father wipe his eyes withal,and yet be seen to bear a woman's face?women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:for raging wind blows up incessant showers,and when the rage allays, the rain begins.these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies:and every drop cries vengeance for his death,'gainst thee, fell clifford, and thee, falsefrenchwoman.northumberland:beshrew me, but his passion moves me sothat hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears.york:that face of his the hungry cannibalswould not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:but you are more inhuman, more inexorable,o, ten times more, than tigers of hyrcania.see, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:this cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,and i with tears do wash the blood away.keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:and if thou tell'st the heavy story right,upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,and say 'alas, it was a piteous deed!'there, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;and in thy need such comfort come to theeas now i reap at thy too cruel hand!hard-hearted clifford, take me from the world:my soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!northumberland:had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,i should not for my life but weep with him.to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.queen margaret:what, weeping-ripe, my lord northumberland?think but upon the wrong he did us all,and that will quickly dry thy melting tears.clifford:here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.queen margaret:and here's to right our gentle-hearted king.york:open thy gate of mercy, gracious god!my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee.queen margaret:off with his head, and set it on york gates;so york may overlook the town of york.3 king henry viedward:i wonder how our princely father 'scaped,or whether he be 'scaped away or nofrom clifford's and northumberland's pursuit:had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;had he been slain, we should have heard the news;or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heardthe happy tidings of his good escape.how fares my brother? why is he so sad?richard:i cannot joy, until i be resolvedwhere our right valiant father is become.i saw him in the battle range about;and watch'd him how he singled clifford forth.methought he bore him in the thickest troopas doth a lion in a herd of neat;or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,the rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.so fared our father with his enemies;so fled his enemies my warlike father:methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.see how the morning opes her golden gates,and takes her farewell of the glorious sun!how well resembles it the prime of youth,trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!edward:dazzle mine eyes, or do i see three suns?richard:three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;not separated with the racking clouds,but sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.see, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,as if they vow'd some league inviolable:now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.in this the heaven figures some event.edward:'tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.i think it cites us, brother, to the field,that we, the sons of brave plantagenet,each one already blazing by our meeds,should notwithstanding join our lights togetherand over-shine the earth as this the world.whate'er it bodes, henceforward will i bearupon my target three fair-shining suns.richard:nay, bear three daughters: by your leave i speak it,you love the breeder better than the male.but what art thou, whose heavy looks foretellsome dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?messenger:ah, one that was a woful looker-onwhen as the noble duke of york was slain,your princely father and my loving lord!edward:o, speak no more, for i have heard too much.richard:say how he died, for i will hear it all.messenger:environed he was with many foes,and stood against them, as the hope of troyagainst the greeks that would have enter'd troy.but hercules himself must yield to odds;and many strokes, though with a little axe,hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.by many hands your father was subdued;but only slaughter'd by the ireful armof unrelenting clifford and the queen,who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeksa napkin steeped in the harmless bloodof sweet young rutland, by rough clifford slain:and after many scorns, many foul taunts,they took his head, and on the gates of yorkthey set the same; and there it doth remain,the saddest spectacle that e'er i view'd.edward:sweet duke of york, our prop to lean upon,now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.o clifford, boisterous clifford! thou hast slainthe flower of europe for his chivalry;and treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,for hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.now my soul's palace is become a prison:ah, would she break from hence, that this my bodymight in the ground be closed up in rest!for never henceforth shall i joy again,never, o never shall i see more joy!richard:i cannot weep; for all my body's moisturescarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;for selfsame wind that i should speak withalis kindling coals that fires all my breast,and burns me up with flames that tears would quench.to weep is to make less the depth of grief:tears then for babes; blows and revenge for merichard, i bear thy name; i'll venge thy death,or die renowned by attempting it.edward:his name that valiant duke hath left with thee;his dukedom and his chair with me is left.richard:nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:for chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.warwick:how now, fair lords! what fare? what news abroad?richard:great lord of warwick, if we should recountour baleful news, and at each word's deliverancestab poniards in our flesh till all were told,the words would add more anguish than the wounds.o valiant lord, the duke of york is slain!edward:o warwick, warwick! that plantagenet,which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,is by the stern lord clifford done to death.warwick:ten days ago i drown'd these news in tears;and now, to add more measure to your woes,i come to tell you things sith then befall'n.after the bloody fray at wakefield fought,where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,were brought me of your loss and his depart.i, then in london keeper of the king,muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,and very well appointed, as i thought,march'd toward saint alban's to intercept the queen,bearing the king in my behalf along;for by my scouts i was advertisedthat she was coming with a full intentto dash our late decree in parliamenttouching king henry's oath and your succession.short tale to make, we at saint alban's metour battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:but whether 'twas the coldness of the king,who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;or whether 'twas report of her success;or more than common fear of clifford's rigour,who thunders to his captives blood and death,i cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,their weapons like to lightning came and went;our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,or like an idle thresher with a flail,fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.i cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,with promise of high pay and great rewards:but all in vain; they had no heart to fight,and we in them no hope to win the day;so that we fled; the king unto the queen;lord george your brother, norfolk and myself,in haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:for in the marches here we heard you were,making another head to fight again.edward:where is the duke of norfolk, gentle warwick?and when came george from burgundy to england?warwick:some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;and for your brother, he was lately sentfrom your kind aunt, duchess of burgundy,with aid of soldiers to this needful war.richard:'twas odds, belike, when valiant warwick fled:oft have i heard his praises in pursuit,but ne'er till now his scandal of retire.warwick:nor now my scandal, richard, dost thou hear;for thou shalt know this strong right hand of minecan pluck the diadem from faint henry's head,and wring the awful sceptre from his fist,were he as famous and as bold in waras he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.richard:i know it well, lord warwick; blame me not:'tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak.but in this troublous time what's to be done?shall we go throw away our coats of steel,and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,numbering our ave-maries with our beads?or shall we on the helmets of our foestell our devotion with revengeful arms?if for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.warwick:why, therefore warwick came to seek you out;and therefore comes my brother montague.attend me, lords. the proud insulting queen,with clifford and the haught northumberland,and of their feather many more proud birds,have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.he swore consent to your succession,his oath enrolled in the parliament;and now to london all the crew are gone,to frustrate both his oath and what besidemay make against the house of lancaster.their power, i think, is thirty thousand strong:now, if the help of norfolk and myself,with all the friends that thou, brave earl of march,amongst the loving welshmen canst procure,will but amount to five and twenty thousand,why, via! to london will we march amain,and once again bestride our foaming steeds,and once again cry 'charge upon our foes!'but never once again turn back and fly.richard:ay, now methinks i hear great warwick speak:ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,that cries 'retire,' if warwick bid him stay.edward:lord warwick, on thy shoulder will i lean;and when thou fail'st--as god forbid the hour!--must edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!warwick:no longer earl of march, but duke of york:the next degree is england's royal throne;for king of england shalt thou be proclaim'din every borough as we pass along;and he that throws not up his cap for joyshall for the fault make forfeit of his head.king edward, valiant richard, montague,stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,but sound the trumpets, and about our task.richard:then, clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,i come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.edward:then strike up drums: god and saint george for us!warwick:how now! what news?messenger:the duke of norfolk sends you word by me,the queen is coming with a puissant host;and craves your company for speedy counsel.warwick:why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.3 king henry viqueen margaret:welcome, my lord, to this brave town of york.yonder's the head of that arch-enemythat sought to be encompass'd with your crown:doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?king henry vi:ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:to see this sight, it irks my very soul.withhold revenge, dear god! 'tis not my fault,nor wittingly have i infringed my vow.clifford:my gracious liege, this too much lenityand harmful pity must be laid aside.to whom do lions cast their gentle looks?not to the beast that would usurp their den.whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?not his that spoils her young before her face.who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?not he that sets his foot upon her back.the smallest worm will turn being trodden on,and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.ambitious york doth level at thy crown,thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:he, but a duke, would have his son a king,and raise his issue, like a loving sire;thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,didst yield consent to disinherit him,which argued thee a most unloving father.unreasonable creatures feed their young;and though man's face be fearful to their eyes,yet, in protection of their tender ones,who hath not seen them, even with those wingswhich sometime they have used with fearful flight,make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,offer their own lives in their young's defence?for shame, my liege, make them your precedent!were it not pity that this goodly boyshould lose his birthright by his father's fault,and long hereafter say unto his child,'what my great-grandfather and his grandsire gotmy careless father fondly gave away'?ah, what a shame were this! look on the boy;and let his manly face, which promisethsuccessful fortune, steel thy melting heartto hold thine own and leave thine own with him.king henry vi:full well hath clifford play'd the orator,inferring arguments of mighty force.but, clifford, tell me, didst thou never hearthat things ill-got had ever bad success?and happy always was it for that sonwhose father for his hoarding went to hell?i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;and would my father had left me no more!for all the rest is held at such a rateas brings a thousand-fold more care to keepthan in possession and jot of pleasure.ah, cousin york! would thy best friends did knowhow it doth grieve me that thy head is here!queen margaret:my lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,and this soft courage makes your followers faint.you promised knighthood to our forward son:unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.edward, kneel down.king henry vi:edward plantagenet, arise a knight;and learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.prince:my gracious father, by your kingly leave,i'll draw it as apparent to the crown,and in that quarrel use it to the death.clifford:why, that is spoken like a toward prince.messenger:royal commanders, be in readiness:for with a band of thirty thousand mencomes warwick, backing of the duke of york;and in the towns, as they do march along,proclaims him king, and many fly to him:darraign your battle, for they are at hand.clifford:i would your highness would depart the field:the queen hath best success when you are absent.queen margaret:ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.king henry vi:why, that's my fortune too; therefore i'll stay.northumberland:be it with resolution then to fight.prince edward:my royal father, cheer these noble lordsand hearten those that fight in your defence:unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'saint george!'edward:now, perjured henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,and set thy diadem upon my head;or bide the mortal fortune of the field?queen margaret:go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!becomes it thee to be thus bold in termsbefore thy sovereign and thy lawful king?edward:i am his king, and he should bow his knee;i was adopted heir by his consent:since when, his oath is broke; for, as i hear,you, that are king, though he do wear the crown,have caused him, by new act of parliament,to blot out me, and put his own son in.clifford:and reason too:who should succeed the father but the son?richard:are you there, butcher? o, i cannot speak!clifford:ay, crook-back, here i stand to answer thee,or any he the proudest of thy sort.richard:'twas you that kill'd young rutland, was it not?clifford:ay, and old york, and yet not satisfied.richard:for god's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.warwick:what say'st thou, henry, wilt thou yield the crown?queen margaret:why, how now, long-tongued warwick! dare you speak?when you and i met at saint alban's last,your legs did better service than your hands.warwick:then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.clifford:you said so much before, and yet you fled.warwick:'twas not your valour, clifford, drove me thence.northumberland:no, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.richard:northumberland, i hold thee reverently.break off the parley; for scarce i can refrainthe execution of my big-swoln heartupon that clifford, that cruel child-killer.clifford:i slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?richard:ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland;but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed.king henry vi:have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.queen margaret:defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.king henry vi:i prithee, give no limits to my tongue:i am a king, and privileged to speak.clifford:my liege, the wound that bred this meeting herecannot be cured by words; therefore be still.richard:then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:by him that made us all, i am resolvedthat clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.edward:say, henry, shall i have my right, or no?a thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.warwick:if thou deny, their blood upon thy head;for york in justice puts his armour on.prince edward:if that be right which warwick says is right,there is no wrong, but every thing is right.richard:whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;for, well i wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.queen margaret:but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;but like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,as venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.richard:iron of naples hid with english gilt,whose father bears the title of a king,--as if a channel should be call'd the sea,--shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,to let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?edward:a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,to make this shameless callet know herself.helen of greece was fairer far than thou,although thy husband may be menelaus;and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wrong'dby that false woman, as this king by thee.his father revell'd in the heart of france,and tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;and had he match'd according to his state,he might have kept that glory to this day;but when he took a beggar to his bed,and graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,that wash'd his father's fortunes forth of france,and heap'd sedition on his crown at home.for what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;and we, in pity of the gentle king,had slipp'd our claim until another age.george:but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,and that thy summer bred us no increase,we set the axe to thy usurping root;and though the edge hath something hit ourselves,yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,we'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.edward:and, in this resolution, i defy thee;not willing any longer conference,since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!and either victory, or else a grave.queen margaret:stay, edward.edward:no, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:these words will cost ten thousand lives this day.3 king henry viwarwick:forspent with toil, as runners with a race,i lay me down a little while to breathe;for strokes received, and many blows repaid,have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile.edward:smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!for this world frowns, and edward's sun is clouded.warwick:how now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?george:our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:what counsel give you? whither shall we fly?edward:bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.richard:ah, warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,broach'd with the steely point of clifford's lance;and in the very pangs of death he cried,like to a dismal clangour heard from far,'warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'so, underneath the belly of their steeds,that stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,the noble gentleman gave up the ghost.warwick:then let the earth be drunken with our blood:i'll kill my horse, because i will not fly.why stand we like soft-hearted women here,wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;and look upon, as if the tragedywere play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?here on my knee i vow to god above,i'll never pause again, never stand still,till either death hath closed these eyes of mineor fortune given me measure of revenge.edward:o warwick, i do bend my knee with thine;and in this vow do chain my soul to thine!and, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,i throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,thou setter up and plucker down of kings,beseeching thee, if with they will it standsthat to my foes this body must be prey,yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,and give sweet passage to my sinful soul!now, lords, take leave until we meet again,where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.richard:brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle warwick,let me embrace thee in my weary arms:i, that did never weep, now melt with woethat winter should cut off our spring-time so.warwick:away, away! once more, sweet lords farewell.george:yet let us all together to our troops,and give them leave to fly that will not stay;and call them pillars that will stand to us;and, if we thrive, promise them such rewardsas victors wear at the olympian games:this may plant courage in their quailing breasts;for yet is hope of life and victory.forslow no longer, make we hence amain.3 king henry virichard:now, clifford, i have singled thee alone:suppose this arm is for the duke of york,and this for rutland; both bound to revenge,wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.clifford:now, richard, i am with thee here alone:this is the hand that stabb'd thy father york;and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland;and here's the heart that triumphs in their deathand cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brotherto execute the like upon thyself;and so, have at thee!richard:nay warwick, single out some other chase;for i myself will hunt this wolf to death.3 king henry viking henry vi:this battle fares like to the morning's war,when dying clouds contend with growing light,what time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,can neither call it perfect day nor night.now sways it this way, like a mighty seaforced by the tide to combat with the wind;now sways it that way, like the selfsame seaforced to retire by fury of the wind:sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;now one the better, then another best;both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,yet neither conqueror nor conquered:so is the equal of this fell war.here on this molehill will i sit me down.to whom god will, there be the victory!for margaret my queen, and clifford too,have chid me from the battle; swearing boththey prosper best of all when i am thence.would i were dead! if god's good will were so;for what is in this world but grief and woe?o god! methinks it were a happy life,to be no better than a homely swain;to sit upon a hill, as i do now,to carve out dials quaintly, point by point,thereby to see the minutes how they run,how many make the hour full complete;how many hours bring about the day;how many days will finish up the year;how many years a mortal man may live.when this is known, then to divide the times:so many hours must i tend my flock;so many hours must i take my rest;so many hours must i contemplate;so many hours must i sport myself;so many days my ewes have been with young;so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:so many years ere i shall shear the fleece:so minutes, hours, days, months, and years,pass'd over to the end they were created,would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shadeto shepherds looking on their silly sheep,than doth a rich embroider'd canopyto kings that fear their subjects' treachery?o, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.and to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,all which secure and sweetly he enjoys,is far beyond a prince's delicates,his viands sparkling in a golden cup,his body couched in a curious bed,when care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.son:ill blows the wind that profits nobody.this man, whom hand to hand i slew in fight,may be possessed with some store of crowns;and i, that haply take them from him now,may yet ere night yield both my life and themto some man else, as this dead man doth me.who's this? o god! it is my father's face,whom in this conflict i unwares have kill'd.o heavy times, begetting such events!from london by the king was i press'd forth;my father, being the earl of warwick's man,came on the part of york, press'd by his master;and i, who at his hands received my life, himhave by my hands of life bereaved him.pardon me, god, i knew not what i did!and pardon, father, for i knew not thee!my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;and no more words till they have flow'd their fill.king henry vi:o piteous spectacle! o bloody times!whiles lions war and battle for their dens,poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.weep, wretched man, i'll aid thee tear for tear;and let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.father:thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:for i have bought it with an hundred blows.but let me see: is this our foeman's face?ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,blown with the windy tempest of my heart,upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!o, pity, god, this miserable age!what stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,this deadly quarrel daily doth beget!o boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,and hath bereft thee of thy life too late!king henry vi:woe above woe! grief more than common grief!o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!o pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!the red rose and the white are on his face,the fatal colours of our striving houses:the one his purple blood right well resembles;the other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:wither one rose, and let the other flourish;if you contend, a thousand lives must wither.son:how will my mother for a father's deathtake on with me and ne'er be satisfied!father:how will my wife for slaughter of my sonshed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!king henry vi:how will the country for these woful chancesmisthink the king and not be satisfied!son:was ever son so rued a father's death?father:was ever father so bemoan'd his son?king henry vi:was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.son:i'll bear thee hence, where i may weep my fill.father:these arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;my heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,for from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;and so obsequious will thy father be,even for the loss of thee, having no more,as priam was for all his valiant sons.i'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,for i have murdered where i should not kill.king henry vi:sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,here sits a king more woful than you are.prince edward:fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,and warwick rages like a chafed bull:away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.queen margaret:mount you, my lord; towards berwick post amain:edward and richard, like a brace of greyhoundshaving the fearful flying hare in sight,with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,and bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.exeter:away! for vengeance comes along with them:nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;or else come after: i'll away before.king henry vi:nay, take me with thee, good sweet exeter:not that i fear to stay, but love to gowhither the queen intends. forward; away!3 king henry viclifford:here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,which, whiles it lasted, gave king henry light.o lancaster, i fear thy overthrowmore than my body's parting with my soul!my love and fear glued many friends to thee;and, now i fall, thy tough commixture melts.impairing henry, strengthening misproud york,the common people swarm like summer flies;and whither fly the gnats but to the sun?and who shines now but henry's enemies?o phoebus, hadst thou never given consentthat phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!and, henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,or as thy father and his father did,giving no ground unto the house of york,they never then had sprung like summer flies;i and ten thousand in this luckless realmhad left no mourning widows for our death;and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;no way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:the foe is merciless, and will not pity;for at their hands i have deserved no pity.the air hath got into my deadly wounds,and much effuse of blood doth make me faint.come, york and richard, warwick and the rest;i stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.edward:now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,that led calm henry, though he were a king,as doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,command an argosy to stem the waves.but think you, lords, that clifford fled with them?warwick:no, 'tis impossible he should escape,for, though before his face i speak the wordsyour brother richard mark'd him for the grave:and wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.edward:whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?richard:a deadly groan, like life and death's departing.edward:see who it is: and, now the battle's ended,if friend or foe, let him be gently used.richard:revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis clifford;who not contented that he lopp'd the branchin hewing rutland when his leaves put forth,but set his murdering knife unto the rootfrom whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,i mean our princely father, duke of york.warwick:from off the gates of york fetch down the head,your father's head, which clifford placed there;instead whereof let this supply the room:measure for measure must be answered.edward:bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,that nothing sung but death to us and ours:now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,and his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.warwick:i think his understanding is bereft.speak, clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,and he nor sees nor hears us what we say.richard:o, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:'tis but his policy to counterfeit,because he would avoid such bitter tauntswhich in the time of death he gave our father.george:if so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.richard:clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.edward:clifford, repent in bootless penitence.warwick:clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.george:while we devise fell tortures for thy faults.richard:thou didst love york, and i am son to york.edward:thou pitied'st rutland; i will pity thee.george:where's captain margaret, to fence you now?warwick:they mock thee, clifford: swear as thou wast wont.richard:what, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hardwhen clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.i know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,if this right hand would buy two hour's life,that i in all despite might rail at him,this hand should chop it off, and with theissuing bloodstifle the villain whose unstanched thirstyork and young rutland could not satisfy.warwick:ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,and rear it in the place your father's stands.and now to london with triumphant march,there to be crowned england's royal king:from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france,and ask the lady bona for thy queen:so shalt thou sinew both these lands together;and, having france thy friend, thou shalt not dreadthe scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.first will i see the coronation;and then to brittany i'll cross the sea,to effect this marriage, so it please my lord.edward:even as thou wilt, sweet warwick, let it be;for in thy shoulder do i build my seat,and never will i undertake the thingwherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.richard, i will create thee duke of gloucester,and george, of clarence: warwick, as ourself,shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.richard:let me be duke of clarence, george of gloucester;for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.warwick:tut, that's a foolish observation:richard, be duke of gloucester. now to london,to see these honours in possession.3 king henry vifirst keeper:under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;for through this laund anon the deer will come;and in this covert will we make our stand,culling the principal of all the deer.second keeper:i'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.first keeper:that cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bowwill scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.here stand we both, and aim we at the best:and, for the time shall not seem tedious,i'll tell thee what befell me on a dayin this self-place where now we mean to stand.second keeper:here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.king henry vi:from scotland am i stol'n, even of pure love,to greet mine own land with my wishful sight.no, harry, harry, 'tis no land of thine;thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:no bending knee will call thee caesar now,no humble suitors press to speak for right,no, not a man comes for redress of thee;for how can i help them, and not myself?first keeper:ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:this is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.king henry vi:let me embrace thee, sour adversity,for wise men say it is the wisest course.second keeper:why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.first keeper:forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.king henry vi:my queen and son are gone to france for aid;and, as i hear, the great commanding warwickis thither gone, to crave the french king's sisterto wife for edward: if this news be true,poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;for warwick is a subtle orator,and lewis a prince soon won with moving words.by this account then margaret may win him;for she's a woman to be pitied much:her sighs will make a battery in his breast;her tears will pierce into a marble heart;the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;and nero will be tainted with remorse,to hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.ay, but she's come to beg, warwick to give;she, on his left side, craving aid for henry,he, on his right, asking a wife for edward.she weeps, and says her henry is deposed;he smiles, and says his edward is install'd;that she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;whiles warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,inferreth arguments of mighty strength,and in conclusion wins the king from her,with promise of his sister, and what else,to strengthen and support king edward's place.o margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!second keeper:say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?king henry vi:more than i seem, and less than i was born to:a man at least, for less i should not be;and men may talk of kings, and why not i?second keeper:ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.king henry vi:why, so i am, in mind; and that's enough.second keeper:but, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?king henry vi:my crown is in my heart, not on my head;not decked with diamonds and indian stones,nor to be seen: my crown is called content:a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.second keeper:well, if you be a king crown'd with content,your crown content and you must be contentedto go along with us; for as we think,you are the king king edward hath deposed;and we his subjects sworn in all allegiancewill apprehend you as his enemy.king henry vi:but did you never swear, and break an oath?second keeper:no, never such an oath; nor will not now.king henry vi:where did you dwell when i was king of england?second keeper:here in this country, where we now remain.king henry vi:i was anointed king at nine months old;my father and my grandfather were kings,and you were sworn true subjects unto me:and tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?first keeper:no;for we were subjects but while you were king.king henry vi:why, am i dead? do i not breathe a man?ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!look, as i blow this feather from my face,and as the air blows it to me again,obeying with my wind when i do blow,and yielding to another when it blows,commanded always by the greater gust;such is the lightness of you common men.but do not break your oaths; for of that sinmy mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.go where you will, the king shall be commanded;and be you kings, command, and i'll obey.first keeper:we are true subjects to the king, king edward.king henry vi:so would you be again to henry,if he were seated as king edward is.first keeper:we charge you, in god's name, and the king's,to go with us unto the officers.king henry vi:in god's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:and what god will, that let your king perform;and what he will, i humbly yield unto.3 king henry viking edward iv:brother of gloucester, at saint alban's fieldthis lady's husband, sir richard grey, was slain,his lands then seized on by the conqueror:her suit is now to repossess those lands;which we in justice cannot well deny,because in quarrel of the house of yorkthe worthy gentleman did lose his life.gloucester:your highness shall do well to grant her suit;it were dishonour to deny it her.king edward iv:it were no less; but yet i'll make a pause.gloucester:clarence:gloucester:king edward iv:widow, we will consider of your suit;and come some other time to know our mind.lady grey:right gracious lord, i cannot brook delay:may it please your highness to resolve me now;and what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.gloucester:clarence:gloucester:king edward iv:how many children hast thou, widow? tell me.clarence:gloucester:lady grey:three, my most gracious lord.gloucester:king edward iv:'twere pity they should lose their father's lands.lady grey:be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.king edward iv:lords, give us leave: i'll try this widow's wit.gloucester:king edward iv:now tell me, madam, do you love your children?lady grey:ay, full as dearly as i love myself.king edward iv:and would you not do much to do them good?lady grey:to do them good, i would sustain some harm.king edward iv:then get your husband's lands, to do them good.lady grey:therefore i came unto your majesty.king edward iv:i'll tell you how these lands are to be got.lady grey:so shall you bind me to your highness' service.king edward iv:what service wilt thou do me, if i give them?lady grey:what you command, that rests in me to do.king edward iv:but you will take exceptions to my boon.lady grey:no, gracious lord, except i cannot do it.king edward iv:ay, but thou canst do what i mean to ask.lady grey:why, then i will do what your grace commands.gloucester:clarence:lady grey:why stops my lord, shall i not hear my task?king edward iv:an easy task; 'tis but to love a king.lady grey:that's soon perform'd, because i am a subject.king edward iv:why, then, thy husband's lands i freely give thee.lady grey:i take my leave with many thousand thanks.gloucester:king edward iv:but stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love i mean.lady grey:the fruits of love i mean, my loving liege.king edward iv:ay, but, i fear me, in another sense.what love, think'st thou, i sue so much to get?lady grey:my love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;that love which virtue begs and virtue grants.king edward iv:no, by my troth, i did not mean such love.lady grey:why, then you mean not as i thought you did.king edward iv:but now you partly may perceive my mind.lady grey:my mind will never grant what i perceiveyour highness aims at, if i aim aright.king edward iv:to tell thee plain, i aim to lie with thee.lady grey:to tell you plain, i had rather lie in prison.king edward iv:why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.lady grey:why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;for by that loss i will not purchase them.king edward iv:therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.lady grey:herein your highness wrongs both them and me.but, mighty lord, this merry inclinationaccords not with the sadness of my suit:please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'king edward iv:ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;no if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.lady grey:then, no, my lord. my suit is at an end.gloucester:clarence:king edward iv:lady grey:'tis better said than done, my gracious lord:i am a subject fit to jest withal,but far unfit to be a sovereign.king edward iv:sweet widow, by my state i swear to theei speak no more than what my soul intends;and that is, to enjoy thee for my love.lady grey:and that is more than i will yield unto:i know i am too mean to be your queen,and yet too good to be your concubine.king edward iv:you cavil, widow: i did mean, my queen.lady grey:'twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.king edward iv:no more than when my daughters call thee mother.thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;and, by god's mother, i, being but a bachelor,have other some: why, 'tis a happy thingto be the father unto many sons.answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.gloucester:clarence:king edward iv:brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.gloucester:the widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.king edward iv:you'll think it strange if i should marry her.clarence:to whom, my lord?king edward iv:why, clarence, to myself.gloucester:that would be ten days' wonder at the least.clarence:that's a day longer than a wonder lasts.gloucester:by so much is the wonder in extremes.king edward iv:well, jest on, brothers: i can tell you bothher suit is granted for her husband's lands.nobleman:my gracious lord, henry your foe is taken,and brought your prisoner to your palace gate.king edward iv:see that he be convey'd unto the tower:and go we, brothers, to the man that took him,to question of his apprehension.widow, go you along. lords, use her honourably.gloucester:ay, edward will use women honourably.would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,to cross me from the golden time i look for!and yet, between my soul's desire and me--the lustful edward's title buried--is clarence, henry, and his son young edward,and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,to take their rooms, ere i can place myself:a cold premeditation for my purpose!why, then, i do but dream on sovereignty;like one that stands upon a promontory,and spies a far-off shore where he would tread,wishing his foot were equal with his eye,and chides the sea that sunders him from thence,saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:so do i wish the crown, being so far off;and so i chide the means that keeps me from it;and so i say, i'll cut the causes off,flattering me with impossibilities.my eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,unless my hand and strength could equal them.well, say there is no kingdom then for richard;what other pleasure can the world afford?i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,and deck my body in gay ornaments,and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.o miserable thought! and more unlikelythan to accomplish twenty golden crowns!why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:and, for i should not deal in her soft laws,she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;to make an envious mountain on my back,where sits deformity to mock my body;to shape my legs of an unequal size;to disproportion me in every part,like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelpthat carries no impression like the dam.and am i then a man to be beloved?o monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!then, since this earth affords no joy to me,but to command, to cheque, to o'erbear suchas are of better person than myself,i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,and, whiles i live, to account this world but hell,until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this headbe round impaled with a glorious crown.and yet i know not how to get the crown,for many lives stand between me and home:and i,--like one lost in a thorny wood,that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,seeking a way and straying from the way;not knowing how to find the open air,but toiling desperately to find it out,--torment myself to catch the english crown:and from that torment i will free myself,or hew my way out with a bloody axe.why, i can smile, and murder whiles i smile,and cry 'content' to that which grieves my heart,and wet my cheeks with artificial tears,and frame my face to all occasions.i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;i'll play the orator as well as nestor,deceive more slily than ulysses could,and, like a sinon, take another troy.i can add colours to the chameleon,change shapes with proteus for advantages,and set the murderous machiavel to school.can i do this, and cannot get a crown?tut, were it farther off, i'll pluck it down.3 king henry viking lewis xi:fair queen of england, worthy margaret,sit down with us: it ill befits thy stateand birth, that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit.queen margaret:no, mighty king of france: now margaretmust strike her sail and learn awhile to servewhere kings command. i was, i must confess,great albion's queen in former golden days:but now mischance hath trod my title down,and with dishonour laid me on the ground;where i must take like seat unto my fortune,and to my humble seat conform myself.king lewis xi:why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?queen margaret:from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tearsand stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.king lewis xi:whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,and sit thee by our side:yield not thy neckto fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mindstill ride in triumph over all mischance.be plain, queen margaret, and tell thy grief;it shall be eased, if france can yield relief.queen margaret:those gracious words revive my drooping thoughtsand give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.now, therefore, be it known to noble lewis,that henry, sole possessor of my love,is of a king become a banish'd man,and forced to live in scotland a forlorn;while proud ambitious edward duke of yorkusurps the regal title and the seatof england's true-anointed lawful king.this is the cause that i, poor margaret,with this my son, prince edward, henry's heir,am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;and if thou fail us, all our hope is done:scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;our people and our peers are both misled,our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,and, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.king lewis xi:renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,while we bethink a means to break it off.queen margaret:the more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.king lewis xi:the more i stay, the more i'll succor thee.queen margaret:o, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!king lewis xi:what's he approacheth boldly to our presence?queen margaret:our earl of warwick, edward's greatest friend.king lewis xi:welcome, brave warwick! what brings thee to france?queen margaret:ay, now begins a second storm to rise;for this is he that moves both wind and tide.warwick:from worthy edward, king of albion,my lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,i come, in kindness and unfeigned love,first, to do greetings to thy royal person;and then to crave a league of amity;and lastly, to confirm that amitywith a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grantthat virtuous lady bona, thy fair sister,to england's king in lawful marriage.queen margaret:warwick:queen margaret:king lewis and lady bona, hear me speak,before you answer warwick. his demandsprings not from edward's well-meant honest love,but from deceit bred by necessity;for how can tyrants safely govern home,unless abroad they purchase great alliance?to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,that henry liveth still: but were he dead,yet here prince edward stands, king henry's son.look, therefore, lewis, that by this league and marriagethou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;for though usurpers sway the rule awhile,yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.warwick:injurious margaret!prince edward:and why not queen?warwick:because thy father henry did usurp;and thou no more are prince than she is queen.oxford:then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt,which did subdue the greatest part of spain;and, after john of gaunt, henry the fourth,whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;and, after that wise prince, henry the fifth,who by his prowess conquered all france:from these our henry lineally descends.warwick:oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,you told not how henry the sixth hath lostall that which henry fifth had gotten?methinks these peers of france should smile at that.but for the rest, you tell a pedigreeof threescore and two years; a silly timeto make prescription for a kingdom's worth.oxford:why, warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,and not bewray thy treason with a blush?warwick:can oxford, that did ever fence the right,now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?for shame! leave henry, and call edward king.oxford:call him my king by whose injurious doommy elder brother, the lord aubrey vere,was done to death? and more than so, my father,even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,when nature brought him to the door of death?no, warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,this arm upholds the house of lancaster.warwick:and i the house of york.king lewis xi:queen margaret, prince edward, and oxford,vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,while i use further conference with warwick.queen margaret:heavens grant that warwick's words bewitch him not!king lewis xi:now warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,is edward your true king? for i were loathto link with him that were not lawful chosen.warwick:thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour.king lewis xi:but is he gracious in the people's eye?warwick:the more that henry was unfortunate.king lewis xi:then further, all dissembling set aside,tell me for truth the measure of his loveunto our sister bona.warwick:such it seemsas may beseem a monarch like himself.myself have often heard him say and swearthat this his love was an eternal plant,whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,the leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,exempt from envy, but not from disdain,unless the lady bona quit his pain.king lewis xi:now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.bona:your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:yet i confess that often ere this day,when i have heard your king's desert recounted,mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.king lewis xi:then, warwick, thus: our sister shall be edward's;and now forthwith shall articles be drawntouching the jointure that your king must make,which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.draw near, queen margaret, and be a witnessthat bona shall be wife to the english king.prince edward:to edward, but not to the english king.queen margaret:deceitful warwick! it was thy deviceby this alliance to make void my suit:before thy coming lewis was henry's friend.king lewis xi:and still is friend to him and margaret:but if your title to the crown be weak,as may appear by edward's good success,then 'tis but reason that i be releasedfrom giving aid which late i promised.yet shall you have all kindness at my handthat your estate requires and mine can yield.warwick:henry now lives in scotland at his ease,where having nothing, nothing can he lose.and as for you yourself, our quondam queen,you have a father able to maintain you;and better 'twere you troubled him than france.queen margaret:peace, impudent and shameless warwick, peace,proud setter up and puller down of kings!i will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,both full of truth, i make king lewis beholdthy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;for both of you are birds of selfsame feather.king lewis xi:warwick, this is some post to us or thee.post:oxford:i like it well that our fair queen and mistresssmiles at her news, while warwick frowns at his.prince edward:nay, mark how lewis stamps, as he were nettled:i hope all's for the best.king lewis xi:warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?queen margaret:mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.warwick:mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.king lewis xi:what! has your king married the lady grey!and now, to soothe your forgery and his,sends me a paper to persuade me patience?is this the alliance that he seeks with france?dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?queen margaret:i told your majesty as much before:this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty.warwick:king lewis, i here protest, in sight of heaven,and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss,that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's,no more my king, for he dishonours me,but most himself, if he could see his shame.did i forget that by the house of yorkmy father came untimely to his death?did i let pass the abuse done to my niece?did i impale him with the regal crown?did i put henry from his native right?and am i guerdon'd at the last with shame?shame on himself! for my desert is honour:and to repair my honour lost for him,i here renounce him and return to henry.my noble queen, let former grudges pass,and henceforth i am thy true servitor:i will revenge his wrong to lady bona,and replant henry in his former state.queen margaret:warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;and i forgive and quite forget old faults,and joy that thou becomest king henry's friend.warwick:so much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,that, if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish uswith some few bands of chosen soldiers,i'll undertake to land them on our coastand force the tyrant from his seat by war.'tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:and as for clarence, as my letters tell me,he's very likely now to fall from him,for matching more for wanton lust than honour,or than for strength and safety of our country.bona:dear brother, how shall bona be revengedbut by thy help to this distressed queen?queen margaret:renowned prince, how shall poor henry live,unless thou rescue him from foul despair?bona:my quarrel and this english queen's are one.warwick:and mine, fair lady bona, joins with yours.king lewis xi:and mine with hers, and thine, and margaret's.therefore at last i firmly am resolvedyou shall have aid.queen margaret:let me give humble thanks for all at once.king lewis xi:then, england's messenger, return in post,and tell false edward, thy supposed king,that lewis of france is sending over masquersto revel it with him and his new bride:thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.bona:tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,i'll wear the willow garland for his sake.queen margaret:tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,and i am ready to put armour on.warwick:tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long.there's thy reward: be gone.king lewis xi:but, warwick,thou and oxford, with five thousand men,shall cross the seas, and bid false edward battle;and, as occasion serves, this noble queenand prince shall follow with a fresh supply.yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?warwick:this shall assure my constant loyalty,that if our queen and this young prince agree,i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joyto him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.queen margaret:yes, i agree, and thank you for your motion.son edward, she is fair and virtuous,therefore delay not, give thy hand to warwick;and, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,that only warwick's daughter shall be thine.prince edward:yes, i accept her, for she well deserves it;and here, to pledge my vow, i give my hand.king lewis xi:why stay we now? these soldiers shall be levied,and thou, lord bourbon, our high admiral,shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.i long till edward fall by war's mischance,for mocking marriage with a dame of france.warwick:i came from edward as ambassador,but i return his sworn and mortal foe:matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,but dreadful war shall answer his demand.had he none else to make a stale but me?then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow.i was the chief that raised him to the crown,and i'll be chief to bring him down again:not that i pity henry's misery,but seek revenge on edward's mockery.3 king henry vigloucester:now tell me, brother clarence, what think youof this new marriage with the lady grey?hath not our brother made a worthy choice?clarence:alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to france;how could he stay till warwick made return?somerset:my lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.gloucester:and his well-chosen bride.clarence:i mind to tell him plainly what i think.king edward iv:now, brother of clarence, how like you our choice,that you stand pensive, as half malcontent?clarence:as well as lewis of france, or the earl of warwick,which are so weak of courage and in judgmentthat they'll take no offence at our abuse.king edward iv:suppose they take offence without a cause,they are but lewis and warwick: i am edward,your king and warwick's, and must have my will.gloucester:and shall have your will, because our king:yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.king edward iv:yea, brother richard, are you offended too?gloucester:not i:no, god forbid that i should wish them sever'dwhom god hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pityto sunder them that yoke so well together.king edward iv:setting your scorns and your mislike aside,tell me some reason why the lady greyshould not become my wife and england's queen.and you too, somerset and montague,speak freely what you think.clarence:then this is mine opinion: that king lewisbecomes your enemy, for mocking himabout the marriage of the lady bona.gloucester:and warwick, doing what you gave in charge,is now dishonoured by this new marriage.king edward iv:what if both lewis and warwick be appeasedby such invention as i can devise?montague:yet, to have join'd with france in such alliancewould more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth'gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.hastings:why, knows not montague that of itselfengland is safe, if true within itself?montague:but the safer when 'tis back'd with france.hastings:'tis better using france than trusting france:let us be back'd with god and with the seaswhich he hath given for fence impregnable,and with their helps only defend ourselves;in them and in ourselves our safety lies.clarence:for this one speech lord hastings well deservesto have the heir of the lord hungerford.king edward iv:ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;and for this once my will shall stand for law.gloucester:and yet methinks your grace hath not done well,to give the heir and daughter of lord scalesunto the brother of your loving bride;she better would have fitted me or clarence:but in your bride you bury brotherhood.clarence:or else you would not have bestow'd the heirof the lord bonville on your new wife's son,and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.king edward iv:alas, poor clarence! is it for a wifethat thou art malcontent? i will provide thee.clarence:in choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,which being shallow, you give me leaveto play the broker in mine own behalf;and to that end i shortly mind to leave you.king edward iv:leave me, or tarry, edward will be king,and not be tied unto his brother's will.queen elizabeth:my lords, before it pleased his majestyto raise my state to title of a queen,do me but right, and you must all confessthat i was not ignoble of descent;and meaner than myself have had like fortune.but as this title honours me and mine,so your dislike, to whom i would be pleasing,doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.king edward iv:my love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:what danger or what sorrow can befall thee,so long as edward is thy constant friend,and their true sovereign, whom they must obey?nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,unless they seek for hatred at my hands;which if they do, yet will i keep thee safe,and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.gloucester:king edward iv:now, messenger, what letters or what newsfrom france?post:my sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,but such as i, without your special pardon,dare not relate.king edward iv:go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.what answer makes king lewis unto our letters?post:at my depart, these were his very words:'go tell false edward, thy supposed king,that lewis of france is sending over masquersto revel it with him and his new bride.'king edward iv:is lewis so brave? belike he thinks me henry.but what said lady bona to my marriage?post:these were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:'tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,i'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'king edward iv:i blame not her, she could say little less;she had the wrong. but what said henry's queen?for i have heard that she was there in place.post:'tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,and i am ready to put armour on.'king edward iv:belike she minds to play the amazon.but what said warwick to these injuries?post:he, more incensed against your majestythan all the rest, discharged me with these words:'tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long.'king edward iv:ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?well i will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:they shall have wars and pay for their presumption.but say, is warwick friends with margaret?post:ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd infriendshipthat young prince edward marries warwick's daughter.clarence:belike the elder; clarence will have the younger.now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,for i will hence to warwick's other daughter;that, though i want a kingdom, yet in marriagei may not prove inferior to yourself.you that love me and warwick, follow me.gloucester:king edward iv:clarence and somerset both gone to warwick!yet am i arm'd against the worst can happen;and haste is needful in this desperate case.pembroke and stafford, you in our behalfgo levy men, and make prepare for war;they are already, or quickly will be landed:myself in person will straight follow you.but, ere i go, hastings and montague,resolve my doubt. you twain, of all the rest,are near to warwick by blood and by alliance:tell me if you love warwick more than me?if it be so, then both depart to him;i rather wish you foes than hollow friends:but if you mind to hold your true obedience,give me assurance with some friendly vow,that i may never have you in suspect.montague:so god help montague as he proves true!hastings:and hastings as he favours edward's cause!king edward iv:now, brother richard, will you stand by us?gloucester:ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.king edward iv:why, so! then am i sure of victory.now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,till we meet warwick with his foreign power.3 king henry viwarwick:trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;the common people by numbers swarm to us.but see where somerset and clarence come!speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?clarence:fear not that, my lord.warwick:then, gentle clarence, welcome unto warwick;and welcome, somerset: i hold it cowardiceto rest mistrustful where a noble hearthath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;else might i think that clarence, edward's brother,were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:but welcome, sweet clarence; my daughter shall be thine.and now what rests but, in night's coverture,thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,his soldiers lurking in the towns about,and but attended by a simple guard,we may surprise and take him at our pleasure?our scouts have found the adventure very easy:that as ulysses and stout diomedewith sleight and manhood stole to rhesus' tents,and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds,so we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,at unawares may beat down edward's guardand seize himself; i say not, slaughter him,for i intend but only to surprise him.you that will follow me to this attempt,applaud the name of henry with your leader.why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:for warwick and his friends, god and saint george!3 king henry vifirst watchman:come on, my masters, each man take his stand:the king by this is set him down to sleep.second watchman:what, will he not to bed?first watchman:why, no; for he hath made a solemn vownever to lie and take his natural resttill warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.second watchman:to-morrow then belike shall be the day,if warwick be so near as men report.third watchman:but say, i pray, what nobleman is thatthat with the king here resteth in his tent?first watchman:'tis the lord hastings, the king's chiefest friend.third watchman:o, is it so? but why commands the kingthat his chief followers lodge in towns about him,while he himself keeps in the cold field?second watchman:'tis the more honour, because more dangerous.third watchman:ay, but give me worship and quietness;i like it better than a dangerous honour.if warwick knew in what estate he stands,'tis to be doubted he would waken him.first watchman:unless our halberds did shut up his passage.second watchman:ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,but to defend his person from night-foes?warwick:this is his tent; and see where stand his guard.courage, my masters! honour now or never!but follow me, and edward shall be ours.first watchman:who goes there?second watchman:stay, or thou diest!somerset:what are they that fly there?warwick:richard and hastings: let them go; here is the duke.king edward iv:the duke! why, warwick, when we parted,thou call'dst me king.warwick:ay, but the case is alter'd:when you disgraced me in my embassade,then i degraded you from being king,and come now to create you duke of york.alas! how should you govern any kingdom,that know not how to use ambassadors,nor how to be contented with one wife,nor how to use your brothers brotherly,nor how to study for the people's welfare,nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?king edward iv:yea, brother of clarence, are thou here too?nay, then i see that edward needs must down.yet, warwick, in despite of all mischance,of thee thyself and all thy complices,edward will always bear himself as king:though fortune's malice overthrow my state,my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.warwick:then, for his mind, be edward england's king:but henry now shall wear the english crown,and be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.my lord of somerset, at my request,see that forthwith duke edward be convey'dunto my brother, archbishop of york.when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows,i'll follow you, and tell what answerlewis and the lady bona send to him.now, for a while farewell, good duke of york.king edward iv:what fates impose, that men must needs abide;it boots not to resist both wind and tide.oxford:what now remains, my lords, for us to dobut march to london with our soldiers?warwick:ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;to free king henry from imprisonmentand see him seated in the regal throne.3 king henry virivers:madam, what makes you in this sudden change?queen elizabeth:why brother rivers, are you yet to learnwhat late misfortune is befall'n king edward?rivers:what! loss of some pitch'd battle against warwick?queen elizabeth:no, but the loss of his own royal person.rivers:then is my sovereign slain?queen elizabeth:ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,either betray'd by falsehood of his guardor by his foe surprised at unawares:and, as i further have to understand,is new committed to the bishop of york,fell warwick's brother and by that our foe.rivers:these news i must confess are full of grief;yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.queen elizabeth:till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.and i the rather wean me from despairfor love of edward's offspring in my womb:this is it that makes me bridle passionand bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;ay, ay, for this i draw in many a tearand stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drownking edward's fruit, true heir to the english crown.rivers:but, madam, where is warwick then become?queen elizabeth:i am inform'd that he comes towards london,to set the crown once more on henry's head:guess thou the rest; king edward's friends must down,but, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--for trust not him that hath once broken faith,--i'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,to save at least the heir of edward's right:there shall i rest secure from force and fraud.come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:if warwick take us we are sure to die.3 king henry vigloucester:now, my lord hastings and sir william stanley,leave off to wonder why i drew you hither,into this chiefest thicket of the park.thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose handshe hath good usage and great liberty,and, often but attended with weak guard,comes hunting this way to disport himself.i have advertised him by secret meansthat if about this hour he make his wayunder the colour of his usual game,he shall here find his friends with horse and mento set him free from his captivity.huntsman:this way, my lord; for this way lies the game.king edward iv:nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.now, brother of gloucester, lord hastings, and the rest,stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?gloucester:brother, the time and case requireth haste:your horse stands ready at the park-corner.king edward iv:but whither shall we then?hastings:to lynn, my lord,and ship from thence to flanders.gloucester:well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.king edward iv:stanley, i will requite thy forwardness.gloucester:but wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.king edward iv:huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?huntsman:better do so than tarry and be hang'd.gloucester:come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.king edward iv:bishop, farewell: shield thee from warwick's frown;and pray that i may repossess the crown.3 king henry viking henry vi:master lieutenant, now that god and friendshave shaken edward from the regal seat,and turn'd my captive state to liberty,my fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,at our enlargement what are thy due fees?lieutenant:subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;but if an humble prayer may prevail,i then crave pardon of your majesty.king henry vi:for what, lieutenant? for well using me?nay, be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness,for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;ay, such a pleasure as incaged birdsconceive when after many moody thoughtsat last by notes of household harmonythey quite forget their loss of liberty.but, warwick, after god, thou set'st me free,and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee;he was the author, thou the instrument.therefore, that i may conquer fortune's spiteby living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,and that the people of this blessed landmay not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,warwick, although my head still wear the crown,i here resign my government to thee,for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.warwick:your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;and now may seem as wise as virtuous,by spying and avoiding fortune's malice,for few men rightly temper with the stars:yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,for choosing me when clarence is in place.clarence:no, warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,to whom the heavens in thy nativityadjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,as likely to be blest in peace and war;and therefore i yield thee my free consent.warwick:and i choose clarence only for protector.king henry vi:warwick and clarence give me both your hands:now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,that no dissension hinder government:i make you both protectors of this land,while i myself will lead a private lifeand in devotion spend my latter days,to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise.warwick:what answers clarence to his sovereign's will?clarence:that he consents, if warwick yield consent;for on thy fortune i repose myself.warwick:why, then, though loath, yet must i be content:we'll yoke together, like a double shadowto henry's body, and supply his place;i mean, in bearing weight of government,while he enjoys the honour and his ease.and, clarence, now then it is more than needfulforthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor,and all his lands and goods be confiscate.clarence:what else? and that succession be determined.warwick:ay, therein clarence shall not want his part.king henry vi:but, with the first of all your chief affairs,let me entreat, for i command no more,that margaret your queen and my son edwardbe sent for, to return from france with speed;for, till i see them here, by doubtful fearmy joy of liberty is half eclipsed.clarence:it shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.king henry vi:my lord of somerset, what youth is that,of whom you seem to have so tender care?somerset:my liege, it is young henry, earl of richmond.king henry vi:come hither, england's hope.if secret powerssuggest but truth to my divining thoughts,this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.his looks are full of peaceful majesty,his head by nature framed to wear a crown,his hand to wield a sceptre, and himselflikely in time to bless a regal throne.make much of him, my lords, for this is hemust help you more than you are hurt by me.warwick:what news, my friend?post:that edward is escaped from your brother,and fled, as he hears since, to burgundy.warwick:unsavoury news! but how made he escape?post:he was convey'd by richard duke of gloucesterand the lord hastings, who attended himin secret ambush on the forest sideand from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;for hunting was his daily exercise.warwick:my brother was too careless of his charge.but let us hence, my sovereign, to providea salve for any sore that may betide.somerset:my lord, i like not of this flight of edward's;for doubtless burgundy will yield him help,and we shall have more wars before 't be long.as henry's late presaging prophecydid glad my heart with hope of this young richmond,so doth my heart misgive me, in these conflictswhat may befall him, to his harm and ours:therefore, lord oxford, to prevent the worst,forthwith we'll send him hence to brittany,till storms be past of civil enmity.oxford:ay, for if edward repossess the crown,'tis like that richmond with the rest shall down.somerset:it shall be so; he shall to brittany.come, therefore, let's about it speedily.3 king henry viking edward iv:now, brother richard, lord hastings, and the rest,yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,and says that once more i shall interchangemy waned state for henry's regal crown.well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seasand brought desired help from burgundy:what then remains, we being thus arrivedfrom ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york,but that we enter, as into our dukedom?gloucester:the gates made fast! brother, i like not this;for many men that stumble at the thresholdare well foretold that danger lurks within.king edward iv:tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:by fair or foul means we must enter in,for hither will our friends repair to us.hastings:my liege, i'll knock once more to summon them.mayor:my lords, we were forewarned of your coming,and shut the gates for safety of ourselves;for now we owe allegiance unto henry.king edward iv:but, master mayor, if henry be your king,yet edward at the least is duke of york.mayor:true, my good lord; i know you for no less.king edward iv:why, and i challenge nothing but my dukedom,as being well content with that alone.gloucester:hastings:why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?open the gates; we are king henry's friends.mayor:ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.gloucester:a wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!hastings:the good old man would fain that all were well,so 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,i doubt not, i, but we shall soon persuadeboth him and all his brothers unto reason.king edward iv:so, master mayor: these gates must not be shutbut in the night or in the time of war.what! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;for edward will defend the town and thee,and all those friends that deign to follow me.gloucester:brother, this is sir john montgomery,our trusty friend, unless i be deceived.king edward iv:welcome, sir john! but why come you in arms?montague:to help king edward in his time of storm,as every loyal subject ought to do.king edward iv:thanks, good montgomery; but we now forgetour title to the crown and only claimour dukedom till god please to send the rest.montague:then fare you well, for i will hence again:i came to serve a king and not a duke.drummer, strike up, and let us march away.king edward iv:nay, stay, sir john, awhile, and we'll debateby what safe means the crown may be recover'd.montague:what talk you of debating? in few words,if you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,i'll leave you to your fortune and be goneto keep them back that come to succor you:why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?gloucester:why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?king edward iv:when we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.hastings:away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.gloucester:and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:the bruit thereof will bring you many friends.king edward iv:then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,and henry but usurps the diadem.montague:ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;and now will i be edward's champion.hastings:sound trumpet; edward shall be here proclaim'd:come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.soldier:edward the fourth, by the grace of god, king ofengland and france, and lord of ireland, &c.montague:and whosoe'er gainsays king edward's right,by this i challenge him to single fight.all:long live edward the fourth!king edward iv:thanks, brave montgomery; and thanks unto you all:if fortune serve me, i'll requite this kindness.now, for this night, let's harbour here in york;and when the morning sun shall raise his carabove the border of this horizon,we'll forward towards warwick and his mates;for well i wot that henry is no soldier.ah, froward clarence! how evil it beseems theeto flatter henry and forsake thy brother!yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and warwick.come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,and, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.3 king henry viwarwick:what counsel, lords? edward from belgia,with hasty germans and blunt hollanders,hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,and with his troops doth march amain to london;and many giddy people flock to him.king henry vi:let's levy men, and beat him back again.clarence:a little fire is quickly trodden out;which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.warwick:in warwickshire i have true-hearted friends,not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;those will i muster up: and thou, son clarence,shalt stir up in suffolk, norfolk, and in kent,the knights and gentlemen to come with thee:thou, brother montague, in buckingham,northampton and in leicestershire, shalt findmen well inclined to hear what thou command'st:and thou, brave oxford, wondrous well beloved,in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.my sovereign, with the loving citizens,like to his island girt in with the ocean,or modest dian circled with her nymphs,shall rest in london till we come to him.fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.farewell, my sovereign.king henry vi:farewell, my hector, and my troy's true hope.clarence:in sign of truth, i kiss your highness' hand.king henry vi:well-minded clarence, be thou fortunate!montague:comfort, my lord; and so i take my leave.oxford:and thus i seal my truth, and bid adieu.king henry vi:sweet oxford, and my loving montague,and all at once, once more a happy farewell.warwick:farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at coventry.king henry vi:here at the palace i will rest awhile.cousin of exeter, what thinks your lordship?methinks the power that edward hath in fieldshould not be able to encounter mine.exeter:the doubt is that he will seduce the rest.king henry vi:that's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:i have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,nor posted off their suits with slow delays;my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,my mercy dried their water-flowing tears;i have not been desirous of their wealth,nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:then why should they love edward more than me?no, exeter, these graces challenge grace:and when the lion fawns upon the lamb,the lamb will never cease to follow him.exeter:hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?king edward iv:seize on the shame-faced henry, bear him hence;and once again proclaim us king of england.you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,and swell so much the higher by their ebb.hence with him to the tower; let him not speak.and, lords, towards coventry bend we our coursewhere peremptory warwick now remains:the sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.gloucester:away betimes, before his forces join,and take the great-grown traitor unawares:brave warriors, march amain towards coventry.3 king henry viwarwick:where is the post that came from valiant oxford?how far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?first messenger:by this at dunsmore, marching hitherward.warwick:how far off is our brother montague?where is the post that came from montague?second messenger:by this at daintry, with a puissant troop.warwick:say, somerville, what says my loving son?and, by thy guess, how nigh is clarence now?somerset:at southam i did leave him with his forces,and do expect him here some two hours hence.warwick:then clarence is at hand, i hear his drum.somerset:it is not his, my lord; here southam lies:the drum your honour hears marcheth from warwick.warwick:who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.somerset:they are at hand, and you shall quickly know.king edward iv:go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.gloucester:see how the surly warwick mans the wall!warwick:o unbid spite! is sportful edward come?where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,that we could hear no news of his repair?king edward iv:now, warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,call edward king and at his hands beg mercy?and he shall pardon thee these outrages.warwick:nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,call warwick patron and be penitent?and thou shalt still remain the duke of york.gloucester:i thought, at least, he would have said the king;or did he make the jest against his will?warwick:is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?gloucester:ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:i'll do thee service for so good a gift.warwick:'twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother.king edward iv:why then 'tis mine, if but by warwick's gift.warwick:thou art no atlas for so great a weight:and weakling, warwick takes his gift again;and henry is my king, warwick his subject.king edward iv:but warwick's king is edward's prisoner:and, gallant warwick, do but answer this:what is the body when the head is off?gloucester:alas, that warwick had no more forecast,but, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,the king was slily finger'd from the deck!you left poor henry at the bishop's palace,and, ten to one, you'll meet him in the tower.edward:'tis even so; yet you are warwick still.gloucester:come, warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.warwick:i had rather chop this hand off at a blow,and with the other fling it at thy face,than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.king edward iv:sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,this hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hairshall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,'wind-changing warwick now can change no more.'warwick:o cheerful colours! see where oxford comes!oxford:oxford, oxford, for lancaster!gloucester:the gates are open, let us enter too.king edward iv:so other foes may set upon our backs.stand we in good array; for they no doubtwill issue out again and bid us battle:if not, the city being but of small defence,we'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.warwick:o, welcome, oxford! for we want thy help.montague:montague, montague, for lancaster!gloucester:thou and thy brother both shall buy this treasoneven with the dearest blood your bodies bear.king edward iv:the harder match'd, the greater victory:my mind presageth happy gain and conquest.somerset:somerset, somerset, for lancaster!gloucester:two of thy name, both dukes of somerset,have sold their lives unto the house of york;and thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.warwick:and lo, where george of clarence sweeps along,of force enough to bid his brother battle;with whom an upright zeal to right prevailsmore than the nature of a brother's love!come, clarence, come; thou wilt, if warwick call.clarence:father of warwick, know you what this means?look here, i throw my infamy at theei will not ruinate my father's house,who gave his blood to lime the stones together,and set up lancaster. why, trow'st thou, warwick,that clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,to bend the fatal instruments of waragainst his brother and his lawful king?perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:to keep that oath were more impietythan jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.i am so sorry for my trespass madethat, to deserve well at my brother's hands,i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,with resolution, wheresoe'er i meet thee--as i will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--to plague thee for thy foul misleading me.and so, proud-hearted warwick, i defy thee,and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.pardon me, edward, i will make amends:and, richard, do not frown upon my faults,for i will henceforth be no more unconstant.king edward iv:now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.gloucester:welcome, good clarence; this is brotherlike.warwick:o passing traitor, perjured and unjust!king edward iv:what, warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?warwick:alas, i am not coop'd here for defence!i will away towards barnet presently,and bid thee battle, edward, if thou darest.king edward iv:yes, warwick, edward dares, and leads the way.lords, to the field; saint george and victory!3 king henry viking edward iv:so, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;for warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.now, montague, sit fast; i seek for thee,that warwick's bones may keep thine company.warwick:ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,and tell me who is victor, york or warwick?why ask i that? my mangled body shows,my blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.that i must yield my body to the earthand, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,under whose shade the ramping lion slept,whose top-branch overpeer'd jove's spreading treeand kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.these eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,to search the secret treasons of the world:the wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;for who lived king, but i could dig his grave?and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow?lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!my parks, my walks, my manors that i had.even now forsake me, and of all my landsis nothing left me but my body's length.why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?and, live we how we can, yet die we must.somerset:ah, warwick, warwick! wert thou as we are.we might recover all our loss again;the queen from france hath brought a puissant power:even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!warwick:why, then i would not fly. ah, montague,if thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,thy tears would wash this cold congealed bloodthat glues my lips and will not let me speak.come quickly, montague, or i am dead.somerset:ah, warwick! montague hath breathed his last;and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick,and said 'commend me to my valiant brother.'and more he would have said, and more he spoke,which sounded like a clamour in a vault,that mought not be distinguished; but at lasti well might hear, delivered with a groan,'o, farewell, warwick!'warwick:sweet rest his soul! fly, lords, and save yourselves;for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.oxford:away, away, to meet the queen's great power!3 king henry viking edward iv:thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,and we are graced with wreaths of victory.but, in the midst of this bright-shining day,i spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,that will encounter with our glorious sun,ere he attain his easeful western bed:i mean, my lords, those powers that the queenhath raised in gallia have arrived our coastand, as we hear, march on to fight with us.clarence:a little gale will soon disperse that cloudand blow it to the source from whence it came:the very beams will dry those vapours up,for every cloud engenders not a storm.gloucester:the queen is valued thirty thousand strong,and somerset, with oxford fled to her:if she have time to breathe be well assuredher faction will be full as strong as ours.king edward iv:we are advertised by our loving friendsthat they do hold their course toward tewksbury:we, having now the best at barnet field,will thither straight, for willingness rids way;and, as we march, our strength will be augmentedin every county as we go along.strike up the drum; cry 'courage!' and away.3 king henry viqueen margaret:great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,but cheerly seek how to redress their harms.what though the mast be now blown overboard,the cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,and half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?yet lives our pilot still. is't meet that heshould leave the helm and like a fearful ladwith tearful eyes add water to the seaand give more strength to that which hath too much,whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,which industry and courage might have saved?ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!say warwick was our anchor; what of that?and montague our topmost; what of him?our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?why, is not oxford here another anchor?and somerset another goodly mast?the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings?and, though unskilful, why not ned and ifor once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?we will not from the helm to sit and weep,but keep our course, though the rough wind say no,from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.as good to chide the waves as speak them fair.and what is edward but ruthless sea?what clarence but a quicksand of deceit?and richard but a ragged fatal rock?all these the enemies to our poor bark.say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,or else you famish; that's a threefold death.this speak i, lords, to let you understand,if case some one of you would fly from us,that there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothersmore than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.why, courage then! what cannot be avoided'twere childish weakness to lament or fear.prince edward:methinks a woman of this valiant spiritshould, if a coward heard her speak these words,infuse his breast with magnanimityand make him, naked, foil a man at arms.i speak not this as doubting any herefor did i but suspect a fearful manhe should have leave to go away betimes,lest in our need he might infect anotherand make him of like spirit to himself.if any such be here--as god forbid!--let him depart before we need his help.oxford:women and children of so high a courage,and warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.o brave young prince! thy famous grandfatherdoth live again in thee: long mayst thou liveto bear his image and renew his glories!somerset:and he that will not fight for such a hope.go home to bed, and like the owl by day,if he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.queen margaret:thanks, gentle somerset; sweet oxford, thanks.prince edward:and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.messenger:prepare you, lords, for edward is at hand.ready to fight; therefore be resolute.oxford:i thought no less: it is his policyto haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.somerset:but he's deceived; we are in readiness.queen margaret:this cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.oxford:here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.king edward iv:brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.i need not add more fuel to your fire,for well i wot ye blaze to burn them outgive signal to the fight, and to it, lords!queen margaret:lords, knights, and gentlemen, what i should saymy tears gainsay; for every word i speak,ye see, i drink the water of mine eyes.therefore, no more but this: henry, your sovereign,is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,his realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,his statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;and yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.you fight in justice: then, in god's name, lords,be valiant and give signal to the fight.3 king henry viking edward iv:now here a period of tumultuous broils.away with oxford to hames castle straight:for somerset, off with his guilty head.go, bear them hence; i will not hear them speak.oxford:for my part, i'll not trouble thee with words.somerset:nor i, but stoop with patience to my fortune.queen margaret:so part we sadly in this troublous world,to meet with joy in sweet jerusalem.king edward iv:is proclamation made, that who finds edwardshall have a high reward, and he his life?gloucester:it is: and lo, where youthful edward comes!king edward iv:bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.what! can so young a thorn begin to prick?edward, what satisfaction canst thou makefor bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,and all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?prince edward:speak like a subject, proud ambitious york!suppose that i am now my father's mouth;resign thy chair, and where i stand kneel thou,whilst i propose the selfsame words to thee,which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.queen margaret:ah, that thy father had been so resolved!gloucester:that you might still have worn the petticoat,and ne'er have stol'n the breech from lancaster.prince edward:let aesop fable in a winter's night;his currish riddles sort not with this place.gloucester:by heaven, brat, i'll plague ye for that word.queen margaret:ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.gloucester:for god's sake, take away this captive scold.prince edward:nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.king edward iv:peace, wilful boy, or i will charm your tongue.clarence:untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.prince edward:i know my duty; you are all undutiful:lascivious edward, and thou perjured george,and thou mis-shapen dick, i tell ye alli am your better, traitors as ye are:and thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.king edward iv:take that, thou likeness of this railer here.gloucester:sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.clarence:and there's for twitting me with perjury.queen margaret:o, kill me too!gloucester:marry, and shall.king edward iv:hold, richard, hold; for we have done too much.gloucester:why should she live, to fill the world with words?king edward iv:what, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.gloucester:clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;i'll hence to london on a serious matter:ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.clarence:what? what?gloucester:the tower, the tower.queen margaret:o ned, sweet ned! speak to thy mother, boy!canst thou not speak? o traitors! murderers!they that stabb'd caesar shed no blood at all,did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,if this foul deed were by to equal it:he was a man; this, in respect, a child:and men ne'er spend their fury on a child.what's worse than murderer, that i may name it?no, no, my heart will burst, and if i speak:and i will speak, that so my heart may burst.butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!how sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!you have no children, butchers! if you had,the thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:but if you ever chance to have a child,look in his youth to have him so cut offas, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!king edward iv:away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.queen margaret:nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,here sheathe thy sword, i'll pardon thee my death:what, wilt thou not? then, clarence, do it thou.clarence:by heaven, i will not do thee so much ease.queen margaret:good clarence, do; sweet clarence, do thou do it.clarence:didst thou not hear me swear i would not do it?queen margaret:ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:'twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.what, wilt thou not? where is that devil's butcher,hard-favour'd richard? richard, where art thou?thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.king edward iv:away, i say; i charge ye, bear her hence.queen margaret:so come to you and yours, as to this prince!king edward iv:where's richard gone?clarence:to london, all in post; and, as i guess,to make a bloody supper in the tower.king edward iv:he's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.now march we hence: discharge the common sortwith pay and thanks, and let's away to londonand see our gentle queen how well she fares:by this, i hope, she hath a son for me.3 king henry vigloucester:good day, my lord. what, at your book so hard?king henry vi:ay, my good lord:--my lord, i should say rather;'tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:'good gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,and both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'gloucester:sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.king henry vi:so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleeceand next his throat unto the butcher's knife.what scene of death hath roscius now to act?gloucester:suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;the thief doth fear each bush an officer.king henry vi:the bird that hath been limed in a bush,with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;and i, the hapless male to one sweet bird,have now the fatal object in my eyewhere my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.gloucester:why, what a peevish fool was that of crete,that taught his son the office of a fowl!an yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.king henry vi:i, daedalus; my poor boy, icarus;thy father, minos, that denied our course;the sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boythy brother edward, and thyself the seawhose envious gulf did swallow up his life.ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!my breast can better brook thy dagger's pointthan can my ears that tragic history.but wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?gloucester:think'st thou i am an executioner?king henry vi:a persecutor, i am sure, thou art:if murdering innocents be executing,why, then thou art an executioner.gloucester:thy son i kill'd for his presumption.king henry vi:hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.and thus i prophesy, that many a thousand,which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,and many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,and many an orphan's water-standing eye--men for their sons, wives for their husbands,and orphans for their parents timeless death--shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.the owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;the night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;the raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,and chattering pies in dismal discords sung.thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,and, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,to wit, an indigested and deformed lump,not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,to signify thou camest to bite the world:and, if the rest be true which i have heard,thou camest--gloucester:i'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:for this amongst the rest, was i ordain'd.king henry vi:ay, and for much more slaughter after this.god forgive my sins, and pardon thee!gloucester:what, will the aspiring blood of lancastersink in the ground? i thought it would have mounted.see how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!o, may such purple tears be alway shedfrom those that wish the downfall of our house!if any spark of life be yet remaining,down, down to hell; and say i sent thee thither:i, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.indeed, 'tis true that henry told me of;for i have often heard my mother sayi came into the world with my legs forward:had i not reason, think ye, to make haste,and seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?the midwife wonder'd and the women cried'o, jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'and so i was; which plainly signifiedthat i should snarl and bite and play the dog.then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.i have no brother, i am like no brother;and this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,be resident in men like one anotherand not in me: i am myself alone.clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:but i will sort a pitchy day for thee;for i will buz abroad such propheciesthat edward shall be fearful of his life,and then, to purge his fear, i'll be thy death.king henry and the prince his son are gone:clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,counting myself but bad till i be best.i'll throw thy body in another roomand triumph, henry, in thy day of doom.3 king henry viking edward iv:once more we sit in england's royal throne,re-purchased with the blood of enemies.what valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!three dukes of somerset, threefold renown'dfor hardy and undoubted champions;two cliffords, as the father and the son,and two northumberlands; two braver menne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;with them, the two brave bears, warwick and montague,that in their chains fetter'd the kingly lionand made the forest tremble when they roar'd.thus have we swept suspicion from our seatand made our footstool of security.come hither, bess, and let me kiss my boy.young ned, for thee, thine uncles and myselfhave in our armours watch'd the winter's night,went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,that thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;and of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.gloucester:king edward iv:clarence and gloucester, love my lovely queen;and kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.clarence:the duty that i owe unto your majestyi seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.queen elizabeth:thanks, noble clarence; worthy brother, thanks.gloucester:and, that i love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,witness the loving kiss i give the fruit.king edward iv:now am i seated as my soul delights,having my country's peace and brothers' loves.clarence:what will your grace have done with margaret?reignier, her father, to the king of francehath pawn'd the sicils and jerusalem,and hither have they sent it for her ransom.king edward iv:away with her, and waft her hence to france.and now what rests but that we spend the timewith stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,such as befits the pleasure of the court?sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!for here, i hope, begins our lasting joy.archidamus:if you shall chance, camillo, to visit bohemia, onthe like occasion whereon my services are now onfoot, you shall see, as i have said, greatdifference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia.camillo:i think, this coming summer, the king of siciliameans to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.archidamus:wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will bejustified in our loves; for indeed--camillo:beseech you,--archidamus:verily, i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--i knownot what to say. we will give you sleepy drinks,that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuseus.camillo:you pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.archidamus:believe me, i speak as my understanding instructs meand as mine honesty puts it to utterance.camillo:sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to bohemia.they were trained together in their childhoods; andthere rooted betwixt them then such an affection,which cannot choose but branch now. since theirmore mature dignities and royal necessities madeseparation of their society, their encounters,though not personal, have been royally attorneyedwith interchange of gifts, letters, lovingembassies; that they have seemed to be together,though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, andembraced, as it were, from the ends of opposedwinds. the heavens continue their loves!archidamus:i think there is not in the world either malice ormatter to alter it. you have an unspeakablecomfort of your young prince mamillius: it is agentleman of the greatest promise that ever cameinto my note.camillo:i very well agree with you in the hopes of him: itis a gallant child; one that indeed physics thesubject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went oncrutches ere he was born desire yet their life tosee him a man.archidamus:would they else be content to die?camillo:yes; if there were no other excuse why they shoulddesire to live.archidamus:if the king had no son, they would desire to liveon crutches till he had one.polixenes:nine changes of the watery star hath beenthe shepherd's note since we have left our thronewithout a burthen: time as long againwould be find up, my brother, with our thanks;and yet we should, for perpetuity,go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,yet standing in rich place, i multiplywith one 'we thank you' many thousands moethat go before it.leontes:stay your thanks a while;and pay them when you part.polixenes:sir, that's to-morrow.i am question'd by my fears, of what may chanceor breed upon our absence; that may blowno sneaping winds at home, to make us say'this is put forth too truly:' besides, i have stay'dto tire your royalty.leontes:we are tougher, brother,than you can put us to't.polixenes:no longer stay.leontes:one seven-night longer.polixenes:very sooth, to-morrow.leontes:we'll part the time between's then; and in thati'll no gainsaying.polixenes:press me not, beseech you, so.there is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,so soon as yours could win me: so it should now,were there necessity in your request, although'twere needful i denied it. my affairsdo even drag me homeward: which to hinderwere in your love a whip to me; my stayto you a charge and trouble: to save both,farewell, our brother.leontes:tongue-tied, our queen?speak you.hermione:i had thought, sir, to have held my peace untilyou have drawn oaths from him not to stay. you, sir,charge him too coldly. tell him, you are sureall in bohemia's well; this satisfactionthe by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,he's beat from his best ward.leontes:well said, hermione.hermione:to tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:but let him say so then, and let him go;but let him swear so, and he shall not stay,we'll thwack him hence with distaffs.yet of your royal presence i'll adventurethe borrow of a week. when at bohemiayou take my lord, i'll give him my commissionto let him there a month behind the gestprefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, leontes,i love thee not a jar o' the clock behindwhat lady-she her lord. you'll stay?polixenes:no, madam.hermione:nay, but you will?polixenes:i may not, verily.hermione:verily!you put me off with limber vows; but i,though you would seek to unsphere thestars with oaths,should yet say 'sir, no going.' verily,you shall not go: a lady's 'verily' 'sas potent as a lord's. will you go yet?force me to keep you as a prisoner,not like a guest; so you shall pay your feeswhen you depart, and save your thanks. how say you?my prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'verily,'one of them you shall be.polixenes:your guest, then, madam:to be your prisoner should import offending;which is for me less easy to committhan you to punish.hermione:not your gaoler, then,but your kind hostess. come, i'll question youof my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:you were pretty lordings then?polixenes:we were, fair queen,two lads that thought there was no more behindbut such a day to-morrow as to-day,and to be boy eternal.hermione:was not my lordthe verier wag o' the two?polixenes:we were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,and bleat the one at the other: what we changedwas innocence for innocence; we knew notthe doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'dthat any did. had we pursued that life,and our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'dwith stronger blood, we should have answer'd heavenboldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'dhereditary ours.hermione:by this we gatheryou have tripp'd since.polixenes:o my most sacred lady!temptations have since then been born to's; forin those unfledged days was my wife a girl;your precious self had then not cross'd the eyesof my young play-fellow.hermione:grace to boot!of this make no conclusion, lest you sayyour queen and i are devils: yet go on;the offences we have made you do we'll answer,if you first sinn'd with us and that with usyou did continue fault and that you slipp'd notwith any but with us.leontes:is he won yet?hermione:he'll stay my lord.leontes:at my request he would not.hermione, my dearest, thou never spokestto better purpose.hermione:never?leontes:never, but once.hermione:what! have i twice said well? when was't before?i prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make'sas fat as tame things: one good deed dying tonguelessslaughters a thousand waiting upon that.our praises are our wages: you may ride'swith one soft kiss a thousand furlongs erewith spur we beat an acre. but to the goal:my last good deed was to entreat his stay:what was my first? it has an elder sister,or i mistake you: o, would her name were grace!but once before i spoke to the purpose: when?nay, let me have't; i long.leontes:why, that was whenthree crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,ere i could make thee open thy white handand clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter'i am yours for ever.'hermione:'tis grace indeed.why, lo you now, i have spoke to the purpose twice:the one for ever earn'd a royal husband;the other for some while a friend.leontes:mamillius:ay, my good lord.leontes:i' fecks!why, that's my bawcock. what, hastsmutch'd thy nose?they say it is a copy out of mine. come, captain,we must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:and yet the steer, the heifer and the calfare all call'd neat.--still virginallingupon his palm!--how now, you wanton calf!art thou my calf?mamillius:yes, if you will, my lord.leontes:thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that i have,to be full like me: yet they say we arealmost as like as eggs; women say so,that will say anything but were they falseas o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, falseas dice are to be wish'd by one that fixesno bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it trueto say this boy were like me. come, sir page,look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!most dear'st! my collop! can thy dam?--may't be?--affection! thy intention stabs the centre:thou dost make possible things not so held,communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--with what's unreal thou coactive art,and fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credentthou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,and that beyond commission, and i find it,and that to the infection of my brainsand hardening of my brows.polixenes:what means sicilia?hermione:he something seems unsettled.polixenes:how, my lord!what cheer? how is't with you, best brother?hermione:you look as if you held a brow of much distractionare you moved, my lord?leontes:no, in good earnest.how sometimes nature will betray its folly,its tenderness, and make itself a pastimeto harder bosoms! looking on the linesof my boy's face, methoughts i did recoiltwenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,in my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,lest it should bite its master, and so prove,as ornaments oft do, too dangerous:how like, methought, i then was to this kernel,this squash, this gentleman. mine honest friend,will you take eggs for money?mamillius:no, my lord, i'll fight.leontes:you will! why, happy man be's dole! my brother,are you so fond of your young prince as wedo seem to be of ours?polixenes:if at home, sir,he's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,my parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:he makes a july's day short as december,and with his varying childness cures in methoughts that would thick my blood.leontes:so stands this squireofficed with me: we two will walk, my lord,and leave you to your graver steps. hermione,how thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;let what is dear in sicily be cheap:next to thyself and my young rover, he'sapparent to my heart.hermione:if you would seek us,we are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?leontes:to your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,be you beneath the sky.i am angling now,though you perceive me not how i give line.go to, go to!how she holds up the neb, the bill to him!and arms her with the boldness of a wifeto her allowing husband!gone already!inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head andears a fork'd one!go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and iplay too, but so disgraced a part, whose issuewill hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamourwill be my knell. go, play, boy, play.there have been,or i am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;and many a man there is, even at this present,now while i speak this, holds his wife by the arm,that little thinks she has been sluiced in's absenceand his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, bysir smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in'twhiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,as mine, against their will. should all despairthat have revolted wives, the tenth of mankindwould hang themselves. physic for't there is none;it is a bawdy planet, that will strikewhere 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,from east, west, north and south: be it concluded,no barricado for a belly; know't;it will let in and out the enemywith bag and baggage: many thousand on'shave the disease, and feel't not. how now, boy!mamillius:i am like you, they say.leontes:why that's some comfort. what, camillo there?camillo:ay, my good lord.leontes:go play, mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.camillo:you had much ado to make his anchor hold:when you cast out, it still came home.leontes:didst note it?camillo:he would not stay at your petitions: madehis business more material.leontes:didst perceive it?they're here with me already, whispering, rounding'sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,when i shall gust it last. how came't, camillo,that he did stay?camillo:at the good queen's entreaty.leontes:at the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinentbut, so it is, it is not. was this takenby any understanding pate but thine?for thy conceit is soaking, will draw inmore than the common blocks: not noted, is't,but of the finer natures? by some severalsof head-piece extraordinary? lower messesperchance are to this business purblind? say.camillo:business, my lord! i think most understandbohemia stays here longer.leontes:ha!camillo:stays here longer.leontes:ay, but why?camillo:to satisfy your highness and the entreatiesof our most gracious mistress.leontes:satisfy!the entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!let that suffice. i have trusted thee, camillo,with all the nearest things to my heart, as wellmy chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thouhast cleansed my bosom, i from thee departedthy penitent reform'd: but we have beendeceived in thy integrity, deceivedin that which seems so.camillo:be it forbid, my lord!leontes:to bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,if thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,which hoxes honesty behind, restrainingfrom course required; or else thou must be counteda servant grafted in my serious trustand therein negligent; or else a foolthat seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,and takest it all for jest.camillo:my gracious lord,i may be negligent, foolish and fearful;in every one of these no man is free,but that his negligence, his folly, fear,among the infinite doings of the world,sometime puts forth. in your affairs, my lord,if ever i were wilful-negligent,it was my folly; if industriouslyi play'd the fool, it was my negligence,not weighing well the end; if ever fearfulto do a thing, where i the issue doubted,where of the execution did cry outagainst the non-performance, 'twas a fearwhich oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,are such allow'd infirmities that honestyis never free of. but, beseech your grace,be plainer with me; let me know my trespassby its own visage: if i then deny it,'tis none of mine.leontes:ha' not you seen, camillo,--but that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glassis thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--for to a vision so apparent rumourcannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitationresides not in that man that does not think,--my wife is slippery? if thou wilt confess,or else be impudently negative,to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then saymy wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a nameas rank as any flax-wench that puts tobefore her troth-plight: say't and justify't.camillo:i would not be a stander-by to hearmy sovereign mistress clouded so, withoutmy present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,you never spoke what did become you lessthan this; which to reiterate were sinas deep as that, though true.leontes:is whispering nothing?is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?kissing with inside lip? stopping the careerof laughing with a sigh?--a note infallibleof breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyesblind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,that would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;the covering sky is nothing; bohemia nothing;my wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,if this be nothing.camillo:good my lord, be curedof this diseased opinion, and betimes;for 'tis most dangerous.leontes:say it be, 'tis true.camillo:no, no, my lord.leontes:it is; you lie, you lie:i say thou liest, camillo, and i hate thee,pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,or else a hovering temporizer, thatcanst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,inclining to them both: were my wife's liverinfected as her life, she would not livethe running of one glass.camillo:who does infect her?leontes:why, he that wears her like a medal, hangingabout his neck, bohemia: who, if ihad servants true about me, that bare eyesto see alike mine honour as their profits,their own particular thrifts, they would do thatwhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,his cupbearer,--whom i from meaner formhave benched and reared to worship, who mayst seeplainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,how i am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,to give mine enemy a lasting wink;which draught to me were cordial.camillo:sir, my lord,i could do this, and that with no rash potion,but with a lingering dram that should not workmaliciously like poison: but i cannotbelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,so sovereignly being honourable.i have loved thee,--leontes:make that thy question, and go rot!dost think i am so muddy, so unsettled,to appoint myself in this vexation, sullythe purity and whiteness of my sheets,which to preserve is sleep, which being spottedis goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,who i do think is mine and love as mine,without ripe moving to't? would i do this?could man so blench?camillo:i must believe you, sir:i do; and will fetch off bohemia for't;provided that, when he's removed, your highnesswill take again your queen as yours at first,even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealingthe injury of tongues in courts and kingdomsknown and allied to yours.leontes:thou dost advise meeven so as i mine own course have set down:i'll give no blemish to her honour, none.camillo:my lord,go then; and with a countenance as clearas friendship wears at feasts, keep with bohemiaand with your queen. i am his cupbearer:if from me he have wholesome beverage,account me not your servant.leontes:this is all:do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;do't not, thou split'st thine own.camillo:i'll do't, my lord.leontes:i will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.camillo:o miserable lady! but, for me,what case stand i in? i must be the poisonerof good polixenes; and my ground to do'tis the obedience to a master, onewho in rebellion with himself will haveall that are his so too. to do this deed,promotion follows. if i could find exampleof thousands that had struck anointed kingsand flourish'd after, i'ld not do't; but sincenor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,let villany itself forswear't. i mustforsake the court: to do't, or no, is certainto me a break-neck. happy star, reign now!here comes bohemia.polixenes:this is strange: methinksmy favour here begins to warp. not speak?good day, camillo.camillo:hail, most royal sir!polixenes:what is the news i' the court?camillo:none rare, my lord.polixenes:the king hath on him such a countenanceas he had lost some province and a regionloved as he loves himself: even now i met himwith customary compliment; when he,wafting his eyes to the contrary and fallinga lip of much contempt, speeds from me andso leaves me to consider what is breedingthat changeth thus his manners.camillo:i dare not know, my lord.polixenes:how! dare not! do not. do you know, and dare not?be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;for, to yourself, what you do know, you must.and cannot say, you dare not. good camillo,your changed complexions are to me a mirrorwhich shows me mine changed too; for i must bea party in this alteration, findingmyself thus alter'd with 't.camillo:there is a sicknesswhich puts some of us in distemper, buti cannot name the disease; and it is caughtof you that yet are well.polixenes:how! caught of me!make me not sighted like the basilisk:i have look'd on thousands, who have sped the betterby my regard, but kill'd none so. camillo,--as you are certainly a gentleman, theretoclerk-like experienced, which no less adornsour gentry than our parents' noble names,in whose success we are gentle,--i beseech you,if you know aught which does behove my knowledgethereof to be inform'd, imprison't notin ignorant concealment.camillo:i may not answer.polixenes:a sickness caught of me, and yet i well!i must be answer'd. dost thou hear, camillo,i conjure thee, by all the parts of manwhich honour does acknowledge, whereof the leastis not this suit of mine, that thou declarewhat incidency thou dost guess of harmis creeping toward me; how far off, how near;which way to be prevented, if to be;if not, how best to bear it.camillo:sir, i will tell you;since i am charged in honour and by himthat i think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,which must be even as swiftly follow'd asi mean to utter it, or both yourself and mecry lost, and so good night!polixenes:on, good camillo.camillo:i am appointed him to murder you.polixenes:by whom, camillo?camillo:by the king.polixenes:for what?camillo:he thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,as he had seen't or been an instrumentto vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queenforbiddenly.polixenes:o, then my best blood turnto an infected jelly and my namebe yoked with his that did betray the best!turn then my freshest reputation toa savour that may strike the dullest nostrilwhere i arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infectionthat e'er was heard or read!camillo:swear his thought overby each particular star in heaven andby all their influences, you may as wellforbid the sea for to obey the moonas or by oath remove or counsel shakethe fabric of his folly, whose foundationis piled upon his faith and will continuethe standing of his body.polixenes:how should this grow?camillo:i know not: but i am sure 'tis safer toavoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.if therefore you dare trust my honesty,that lies enclosed in this trunk which youshall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!your followers i will whisper to the business,and will by twos and threes at several posternsclear them o' the city. for myself, i'll putmy fortunes to your service, which are hereby this discovery lost. be not uncertain;for, by the honour of my parents, ihave utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,i dare not stand by; nor shall you be saferthan one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereonhis execution sworn.polixenes:i do believe thee:i saw his heart in 's face. give me thy hand:be pilot to me and thy places shallstill neighbour mine. my ships are ready andmy people did expect my hence departuretwo days ago. this jealousyis for a precious creature: as she's rare,must it be great, and as his person's mighty,must it be violent, and as he does conceivehe is dishonour'd by a man which everprofess'd to him, why, his revenges mustin that be made more bitter. fear o'ershades me:good expedition be my friend, and comfortthe gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothingof his ill-ta'en suspicion! come, camillo;i will respect thee as a father ifthou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.camillo:it is in mine authority to commandthe keys of all the posterns: please your highnessto take the urgent hour. come, sir, away.hermione:take the boy to you: he so troubles me,'tis past enduring.first lady:come, my gracious lord,shall i be your playfellow?mamillius:no, i'll none of you.first lady:why, my sweet lord?mamillius:you'll kiss me hard and speak to me as ifi were a baby still. i love you better.second lady:and why so, my lord?mamillius:not for becauseyour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,become some women best, so that there be nottoo much hair there, but in a semicircleor a half-moon made with a pen.second lady:who taught you this?mamillius:i learnt it out of women's faces. pray nowwhat colour are your eyebrows?first lady:blue, my lord.mamillius:nay, that's a mock: i have seen a lady's nosethat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.first lady:hark ye;the queen your mother rounds apace: we shallpresent our services to a fine new princeone of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,if we would have you.second lady:she is spread of lateinto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!hermione:what wisdom stirs amongst you? come, sir, nowi am for you again: pray you, sit by us,and tell 's a tale.mamillius:merry or sad shall't be?hermione:as merry as you will.mamillius:a sad tale's best for winter: i have oneof sprites and goblins.hermione:let's have that, good sir.come on, sit down: come on, and do your bestto fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.mamillius:there was a man--hermione:nay, come, sit down; then on.mamillius:dwelt by a churchyard: i will tell it softly;yond crickets shall not hear it.hermione:come on, then,and give't me in mine ear.leontes:was he met there? his train? camillo with him?first lord:behind the tuft of pines i met them; neversaw i men scour so on their way: i eyed themeven to their ships.leontes:how blest am iin my just censure, in my true opinion!alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursedin being so blest! there may be in the cupa spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,and yet partake no venom, for his knowledgeis not infected: but if one presentthe abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make knownhow he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,with violent hefts. i have drunk,and seen the spider.camillo was his help in this, his pander:there is a plot against my life, my crown;all's true that is mistrusted: that false villainwhom i employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:he has discover'd my design, and iremain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trickfor them to play at will. how came the posternsso easily open?first lord:by his great authority;which often hath no less prevail'd than soon your command.leontes:i know't too well.give me the boy: i am glad you did not nurse him:though he does bear some signs of me, yet youhave too much blood in him.hermione:what is this? sport?leontes:bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;away with him! and let her sport herselfwith that she's big with; for 'tis polixeneshas made thee swell thus.hermione:but i'ld say he had not,and i'll be sworn you would believe my saying,howe'er you lean to the nayward.leontes:you, my lords,look on her, mark her well; be but aboutto say 'she is a goodly lady,' andthe justice of your bearts will thereto add'tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'praise her but for this her without-door form,which on my faith deserves high speech, and straightthe shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brandsthat calumny doth use--o, i am out--that mercy does, for calumny will searvirtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,when you have said 'she's goodly,' come betweenere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,from him that has most cause to grieve it should be,she's an adulteress.hermione:should a villain say so,the most replenish'd villain in the world,he were as much more villain: you, my lord,do but mistake.leontes:you have mistook, my lady,polixenes for leontes: o thou thing!which i'll not call a creature of thy place,lest barbarism, making me the precedent,should a like language use to all degreesand mannerly distinguishment leave outbetwixt the prince and beggar: i have saidshe's an adulteress; i have said with whom:more, she's a traitor and camillo isa federary with her, and one that knowswhat she should shame to know herselfbut with her most vile principal, that she'sa bed-swerver, even as bad as thosethat vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privyto this their late escape.hermione:no, by my life.privy to none of this. how will this grieve you,when you shall come to clearer knowledge, thatyou thus have publish'd me! gentle my lord,you scarce can right me throughly then to sayyou did mistake.leontes:no; if i mistakein those foundations which i build upon,the centre is not big enough to beara school-boy's top. away with her! to prison!he who shall speak for her is afar off guiltybut that he speaks.hermione:there's some ill planet reigns:i must be patient till the heavens lookwith an aspect more favourable. good my lords,i am not prone to weeping, as our sexcommonly are; the want of which vain dewperchance shall dry your pities: but i havethat honourable grief lodged here which burnsworse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,with thoughts so qualified as your charitiesshall best instruct you, measure me; and sothe king's will be perform'd!leontes:shall i be heard?hermione:who is't that goes with me? beseech your highness,my women may be with me; for you seemy plight requires it. do not weep, good fools;there is no cause: when you shall know your mistresshas deserved prison, then abound in tearsas i come out: this action i now go onis for my better grace. adieu, my lord:i never wish'd to see you sorry; nowi trust i shall. my women, come; you have leave.leontes:go, do our bidding; hence!first lord:beseech your highness, call the queen again.antigonus:be certain what you do, sir, lest your justiceprove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,yourself, your queen, your son.first lord:for her, my lord,i dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,please you to accept it, that the queen is spotlessi' the eyes of heaven and to you; i mean,in this which you accuse her.antigonus:if it proveshe's otherwise, i'll keep my stables wherei lodge my wife; i'll go in couples with her;than when i feel and see her no farther trust her;for every inch of woman in the world,ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, if she be.leontes:hold your peaces.first lord:good my lord,--antigonus:it is for you we speak, not for ourselves:you are abused and by some putter-onthat will be damn'd for't; would i knew the villain,i would land-damn him. be she honour-flaw'd,i have three daughters; the eldest is eleventhe second and the third, nine, and some five;if this prove true, they'll pay for't:by mine honour,i'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,to bring false generations: they are co-heirs;and i had rather glib myself than theyshould not produce fair issue.leontes:cease; no more.you smell this business with a sense as coldas is a dead man's nose: but i do see't and feel'tas you feel doing thus; and see withalthe instruments that feel.antigonus:if it be so,we need no grave to bury honesty:there's not a grain of it the face to sweetenof the whole dungy earth.leontes:what! lack i credit?first lord:i had rather you did lack than i, my lord,upon this ground; and more it would content meto have her honour true than your suspicion,be blamed for't how you might.leontes:why, what need wecommune with you of this, but rather followour forceful instigation? our prerogativecalls not your counsels, but our natural goodnessimparts this; which if you, or stupefiedor seeming so in skill, cannot or will notrelish a truth like us, inform yourselveswe need no more of your advice: the matter,the loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is allproperly ours.antigonus:and i wish, my liege,you had only in your silent judgment tried it,without more overture.leontes:how could that be?either thou art most ignorant by age,or thou wert born a fool. camillo's flight,added to their familiarity,which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,that lack'd sight only, nought for approbationbut only seeing, all other circumstancesmade up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:yet, for a greater confirmation,for in an act of this importance 'tweremost piteous to be wild, i have dispatch'd in postto sacred delphos, to apollo's temple,cleomenes and dion, whom you knowof stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oraclethey will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,shall stop or spur me. have i done well?first lord:well done, my lord.leontes:though i am satisfied and need no morethan what i know, yet shall the oraclegive rest to the minds of others, such as hewhose ignorant credulity will notcome up to the truth. so have we thought it goodfrom our free person she should be confined,lest that the treachery of the two fled hencebe left her to perform. come, follow us;we are to speak in public; for this businesswill raise us all.antigonus:paulina:the keeper of the prison, call to him;let him have knowledge who i am.good lady,no court in europe is too good for thee;what dost thou then in prison?now, good sir,you know me, do you not?gaoler:for a worthy ladyand one whom much i honour.paulina:pray you then,conduct me to the queen.gaoler:i may not, madam:to the contrary i have express commandment.paulina:here's ado,to lock up honesty and honour fromthe access of gentle visitors!is't lawful, pray you,to see her women? any of them? emilia?gaoler:so please you, madam,to put apart these your attendants, ishall bring emilia forth.paulina:i pray now, call her.withdraw yourselves.gaoler:and, madam,i must be present at your conference.paulina:well, be't so, prithee.here's such ado to make no stain a stainas passes colouring.dear gentlewoman,how fares our gracious lady?emilia:as well as one so great and so forlornmay hold together: on her frights and griefs,which never tender lady hath born greater,she is something before her time deliver'd.paulina:a boy?emilia:a daughter, and a goodly babe,lusty and like to live: the queen receivesmuch comfort in't; says 'my poor prisoner,i am innocent as you.'paulina:i dare be swornthese dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,beshrew them!he must be told on't, and he shall: the officebecomes a woman best; i'll take't upon me:if i prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blisterand never to my red-look'd anger bethe trumpet any more. pray you, emilia,commend my best obedience to the queen:if she dares trust me with her little babe,i'll show't the king and undertake to beher advocate to the loud'st. we do not knowhow he may soften at the sight o' the child:the silence often of pure innocencepersuades when speaking fails.emilia:most worthy madam,your honour and your goodness is so evidentthat your free undertaking cannot missa thriving issue: there is no lady livingso meet for this great errand. please your ladyshipto visit the next room, i'll presentlyacquaint the queen of your most noble offer;who but to-day hammer'd of this design,but durst not tempt a minister of honour,lest she should be denied.paulina:tell her, emilia.i'll use that tongue i have: if wit flow from'tas boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubtedi shall do good.emilia:now be you blest for it!i'll to the queen: please you,come something nearer.gaoler:madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,i know not what i shall incur to pass it,having no warrant.paulina:you need not fear it, sir:this child was prisoner to the womb and isby law and process of great nature thencefreed and enfranchised, not a party tothe anger of the king nor guilty of,if any be, the trespass of the queen.gaoler:i do believe it.paulina:do not you fear: upon mine honour,i will stand betwixt you and danger.leontes:nor night nor day no rest: it is but weaknessto bear the matter thus; mere weakness. ifthe cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,she the adulteress; for the harlot kingis quite beyond mine arm, out of the blankand level of my brain, plot-proof; but shei can hook to me: say that she were gone,given to the fire, a moiety of my restmight come to me again. who's there?first servant:my lord?leontes:how does the boy?first servant:he took good rest to-night;'tis hoped his sickness is discharged.leontes:to see his nobleness!conceiving the dishonour of his mother,he straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,and downright languish'd. leave me solely: go,see how he fares.fie, fie! no thought of him:the thought of my revenges that wayrecoil upon me: in himself too mighty,and in his parties, his alliance; let him beuntil a time may serve: for present vengeance,take it on her. camillo and polixeneslaugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:they should not laugh if i could reach them, norshall she within my power.first lord:you must not enter.paulina:nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,more free than he is jealous.antigonus:that's enough.second servant:madam, he hath not slept tonight; commandednone should come at him.paulina:not so hot, good sir:i come to bring him sleep. 'tis such as you,that creep like shadows by him and do sighat each his needless heavings, such as younourish the cause of his awaking: ido come with words as medicinal as true,honest as either, to purge him of that humourthat presses him from sleep.leontes:what noise there, ho?paulina:no noise, my lord; but needful conferenceabout some gossips for your highness.leontes:how!away with that audacious lady! antigonus,i charged thee that she should not come about me:i knew she would.antigonus:i told her so, my lord,on your displeasure's peril and on mine,she should not visit you.leontes:what, canst not rule her?paulina:from all dishonesty he can: in this,unless he take the course that you have done,commit me for committing honour, trust it,he shall not rule me.antigonus:la you now, you hear:when she will take the rein i let her run;but she'll not stumble.paulina:good my liege, i come;and, i beseech you, hear me, who professmyself your loyal servant, your physician,your most obedient counsellor, yet that dareless appear so in comforting your evils,than such as most seem yours: i say, i comefrom your good queen.leontes:good queen!paulina:good queen, my lord,good queen; i say good queen;and would by combat make her good, so were ia man, the worst about you.leontes:force her hence.paulina:let him that makes but trifles of his eyesfirst hand me: on mine own accord i'll off;but first i'll do my errand. the good queen,for she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.leontes:out!a mankind witch! hence with her, out o' door:a most intelligencing bawd!paulina:not so:i am as ignorant in that as youin so entitling me, and no less honestthan you are mad; which is enough, i'll warrant,as this world goes, to pass for honest.leontes:traitors!will you not push her out? give her the bastard.thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroostedby thy dame partlet here. take up the bastard;take't up, i say; give't to thy crone.paulina:for everunvenerable be thy hands, if thoutakest up the princess by that forced basenesswhich he has put upon't!leontes:he dreads his wife.paulina:so i would you did; then 'twere past all doubtyou'ld call your children yours.leontes:a nest of traitors!antigonus:i am none, by this good light.paulina:nor i, nor anybut one that's here, and that's himself, for hethe sacred honour of himself, his queen's,his hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,whose sting is sharper than the sword's;and will not--for, as the case now stands, it is a cursehe cannot be compell'd to't--once removethe root of his opinion, which is rottenas ever oak or stone was sound.leontes:a callatof boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husbandand now baits me! this brat is none of mine;it is the issue of polixenes:hence with it, and together with the damcommit them to the fire!paulina:it is yours;and, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,so like you, 'tis the worse. behold, my lords,although the print be little, the whole matterand copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,the trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,his smiles,the very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:and thou, good goddess nature, which hast made itso like to him that got it, if thou hastthe ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all coloursno yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,her children not her husband's!leontes:a gross hagand, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,that wilt not stay her tongue.antigonus:hang all the husbandsthat cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourselfhardly one subject.leontes:once more, take her hence.paulina:a most unworthy and unnatural lordcan do no more.leontes:i'll ha' thee burnt.paulina:i care not:it is an heretic that makes the fire,not she which burns in't. i'll not call you tyrant;but this most cruel usage of your queen,not able to produce more accusationthan your own weak-hinged fancy, something savoursof tyranny and will ignoble make you,yea, scandalous to the world.leontes:on your allegiance,out of the chamber with her! were i a tyrant,where were her life? she durst not call me so,if she did know me one. away with her!paulina:i pray you, do not push me; i'll be gone.look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:jove send hera better guiding spirit! what needs these hands?you, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,will never do him good, not one of you.so, so: farewell; we are gone.leontes:thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.my child? away with't! even thou, that hasta heart so tender o'er it, take it henceand see it instantly consumed with fire;even thou and none but thou. take it up straight:within this hour bring me word 'tis done,and by good testimony, or i'll seize thy life,with what thou else call'st thine. if thou refuseand wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;the bastard brains with these my proper handsshall i dash out. go, take it to the fire;for thou set'st on thy wife.antigonus:i did not, sir:these lords, my noble fellows, if they please,can clear me in't.lords:we can: my royal liege,he is not guilty of her coming hither.leontes:you're liars all.first lord:beseech your highness, give us better credit:we have always truly served you, and beseech youso to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,as recompense of our dear servicespast and to come, that you do change this purpose,which being so horrible, so bloody, mustlead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.leontes:i am a feather for each wind that blows:shall i live on to see this bastard kneeland call me father? better burn it nowthan curse it then. but be it; let it live.it shall not neither. you, sir, come you hither;you that have been so tenderly officiouswith lady margery, your midwife there,to save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,so sure as this beard's grey,--what will you adventureto save this brat's life?antigonus:any thing, my lord,that my ability may undergoand nobleness impose: at least thus much:i'll pawn the little blood which i have leftto save the innocent: any thing possible.leontes:it shall be possible. swear by this swordthou wilt perform my bidding.antigonus:i will, my lord.leontes:mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the failof any point in't shall not only bedeath to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,whom for this time we pardon. we enjoin thee,as thou art liege-man to us, that thou carrythis female bastard hence and that thou bear itto some remote and desert place quite outof our dominions, and that there thou leave it,without more mercy, to its own protectionand favour of the climate. as by strange fortuneit came to us, i do in justice charge thee,on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,that thou commend it strangely to some placewhere chance may nurse or end it. take it up.antigonus:i swear to do this, though a present deathhad been more merciful. come on, poor babe:some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravensto be thy nurses! wolves and bears, they saycasting their savageness aside have donelike offices of pity. sir, be prosperousin more than this deed does require! and blessingagainst this cruelty fight on thy side,poor thing, condemn'd to loss!leontes:no, i'll not rearanother's issue.servant:please your highness, postsfrom those you sent to the oracle are comean hour since: cleomenes and dion,being well arrived from delphos, are both landed,hasting to the court.first lord:so please you, sir, their speedhath been beyond account.leontes:twenty-three daysthey have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretellsthe great apollo suddenly will havethe truth of this appear. prepare you, lords;summon a session, that we may arraignour most disloyal lady, for, as she hathbeen publicly accused, so shall she havea just and open trial. while she livesmy heart will be a burthen to me. leave me,and think upon my bidding.cleomenes:the climate's delicate, the air most sweet,fertile the isle, the temple much surpassingthe common praise it bears.dion:i shall report,for most it caught me, the celestial habits,methinks i so should term them, and the reverenceof the grave wearers. o, the sacrifice!how ceremonious, solemn and unearthlyit was i' the offering!cleomenes:but of all, the burstand the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,kin to jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.that i was nothing.dion:if the event o' the journeyprove as successful to the queen,--o be't so!--as it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,the time is worth the use on't.cleomenes:great apolloturn all to the best! these proclamations,so forcing faults upon hermione,i little like.dion:the violent carriage of itwill clear or end the business: when the oracle,thus by apollo's great divine seal'd up,shall the contents discover, something rareeven then will rush to knowledge. go: fresh horses!and gracious be the issue!leontes:this sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party triedthe daughter of a king, our wife, and oneof us too much beloved. let us be clear'dof being tyrannous, since we so openlyproceed in justice, which shall have due course,even to the guilt or the purgation.produce the prisoner.officer:it is his highness' pleasure that the queenappear in person here in court. silence!leontes:read the indictment.officer:hermione:since what i am to say must be but thatwhich contradicts my accusation andthe testimony on my part no otherbut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot meto say 'not guilty:' mine integritybeing counted falsehood, shall, as i express it,be so received. but thus: if powers divinebehold our human actions, as they do,i doubt not then but innocence shall makefalse accusation blush and tyrannytremble at patience. you, my lord, best know,who least will seem to do so, my past lifehath been as continent, as chaste, as true,as i am now unhappy; which is morethan history can pattern, though devisedand play'd to take spectators. for behold mea fellow of the royal bed, which owea moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,the mother to a hopeful prince, here standingto prate and talk for life and honour 'forewho please to come and hear. for life, i prize itas i weigh grief, which i would spare: for honour,'tis a derivative from me to mine,and only that i stand for. i appealto your own conscience, sir, before polixenescame to your court, how i was in your grace,how merited to be so; since he came,with what encounter so uncurrent ihave strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyondthe bound of honour, or in act or willthat way inclining, harden'd be the heartsof all that hear me, and my near'st of kincry fie upon my grave!leontes:i ne'er heard yetthat any of these bolder vices wantedless impudence to gainsay what they didthan to perform it first.hermione:that's true enough;through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.leontes:you will not own it.hermione:more than mistress ofwhich comes to me in name of fault, i must notat all acknowledge. for polixenes,with whom i am accused, i do confessi loved him as in honour he required,with such a kind of love as might becomea lady like me, with a love even such,so and no other, as yourself commanded:which not to have done i think had been in meboth disobedience and ingratitudeto you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,even since it could speak, from an infant, freelythat it was yours. now, for conspiracy,i know not how it tastes; though it be dish'dfor me to try how: all i know of itis that camillo was an honest man;and why he left your court, the gods themselves,wotting no more than i, are ignorant.leontes:you knew of his departure, as you knowwhat you have underta'en to do in's absence.hermione:sir,you speak a language that i understand not:my life stands in the level of your dreams,which i'll lay down.leontes:your actions are my dreams;you had a bastard by polixenes,and i but dream'd it. as you were past all shame,--those of your fact are so--so past all truth:which to deny concerns more than avails; for asthy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,no father owning it,--which is, indeed,more criminal in thee than it,--so thoushalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passagelook for no less than death.hermione:sir, spare your threats:the bug which you would fright me with i seek.to me can life be no commodity:the crown and comfort of my life, your favour,i do give lost; for i do feel it gone,but know not how it went. my second joyand first-fruits of my body, from his presencei am barr'd, like one infectious. my third comfortstarr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,haled out to murder: myself on every postproclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatredthe child-bed privilege denied, which 'longsto women of all fashion; lastly, hurriedhere to this place, i' the open air, beforei have got strength of limit. now, my liege,tell me what blessings i have here alive,that i should fear to die? therefore proceed.but yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,i prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,which i would free, if i shall be condemn'dupon surmises, all proofs sleeping elsebut what your jealousies awake, i tell you'tis rigor and not law. your honours all,i do refer me to the oracle:apollo be my judge!first lord:this your requestis altogether just: therefore bring forth,and in apollos name, his oracle.hermione:the emperor of russia was my father:o that he were alive, and here beholdinghis daughter's trial! that he did but seethe flatness of my misery, yet with eyesof pity, not revenge!officer:you here shall swear upon this sword of justice,that you, cleomenes and dion, havebeen both at delphos, and from thence have broughtthe seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'dof great apollo's priest; and that, since then,you have not dared to break the holy sealnor read the secrets in't.cleomenes:all this we swear.leontes:break up the seals and read.officer:lords:now blessed be the great apollo!hermione:praised!leontes:hast thou read truth?officer:ay, my lord; even soas it is here set down.leontes:there is no truth at all i' the oracle:the sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.servant:my lord the king, the king!leontes:what is the business?servant:o sir, i shall be hated to report it!the prince your son, with mere conceit and fearof the queen's speed, is gone.leontes:how! gone!servant:is dead.leontes:apollo's angry; and the heavens themselvesdo strike at my injustice.how now there!paulina:this news is mortal to the queen: look downand see what death is doing.leontes:take her hence:her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:i have too much believed mine own suspicion:beseech you, tenderly apply to hersome remedies for life.apollo, pardonmy great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!i'll reconcile me to polixenes,new woo my queen, recall the good camillo,whom i proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;for, being transported by my jealousiesto bloody thoughts and to revenge, i chosecamillo for the minister to poisonmy friend polixenes: which had been done,but that the good mind of camillo tardiedmy swift command, though i with death and withreward did threaten and encourage him,not doing 't and being done: he, most humaneand fill'd with honour, to my kingly guestunclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,which you knew great, and to the hazardof all encertainties himself commended,no richer than his honour: how he glistersthorough my rust! and how his pitydoes my deeds make the blacker!paulina:woe the while!o, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,break too.first lord:what fit is this, good lady?paulina:what studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?what wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?in leads or oils? what old or newer torturemust i receive, whose every word deservesto taste of thy most worst? thy tyrannytogether working with thy jealousies,fancies too weak for boys, too green and idlefor girls of nine, o, think what they have doneand then run mad indeed, stark mad! for allthy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.that thou betray'dst polixenes,'twas nothing;that did but show thee, of a fool, inconstantand damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,thou wouldst have poison'd good camillo's honour,to have him kill a king: poor trespasses,more monstrous standing by: whereof i reckonthe casting forth to crows thy baby-daughterto be or none or little; though a devilwould have shed water out of fire ere done't:nor is't directly laid to thee, the deathof the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heartthat could conceive a gross and foolish sireblemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,laid to thy answer: but the last,--o lords,when i have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,the sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,and vengeance for'tnot dropp'd down yet.first lord:the higher powers forbid!paulina:i say she's dead; i'll swear't. if word nor oathprevail not, go and see: if you can bringtincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,heat outwardly or breath within, i'll serve youas i would do the gods. but, o thou tyrant!do not repent these things, for they are heavierthan all thy woes can stir; therefore betake theeto nothing but despair. a thousand kneesten thousand years together, naked, fasting,upon a barren mountain and still winterin storm perpetual, could not move the godsto look that way thou wert.leontes:go on, go onthou canst not speak too much; i have deservedall tongues to talk their bitterest.first lord:say no more:howe'er the business goes, you have made faulti' the boldness of your speech.paulina:i am sorry for't:all faults i make, when i shall come to know them,i do repent. alas! i have show'd too muchthe rashness of a woman: he is touch'dto the noble heart. what's gone and what's past helpshould be past grief: do not receive afflictionat my petition; i beseech you, ratherlet me be punish'd, that have minded youof what you should forget. now, good my liegesir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:the love i bore your queen--lo, fool again!--i'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;i'll not remember you of my own lord,who is lost too: take your patience to you,and i'll say nothing.leontes:thou didst speak but wellwhen most the truth; which i receive much betterthan to be pitied of thee. prithee, bring meto the dead bodies of my queen and son:one grave shall be for both: upon them shallthe causes of their death appear, untoour shame perpetual. once a day i'll visitthe chapel where they lie, and tears shed thereshall be my recreation: so long as naturewill bear up with this exercise, so longi daily vow to use it. come and lead meunto these sorrows.antigonus:thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd uponthe deserts of bohemia?mariner:ay, my lord: and fearwe have landed in ill time: the skies look grimlyand threaten present blusters. in my conscience,the heavens with that we have in hand are angryand frown upon 's.antigonus:their sacred wills be done! go, get aboard;look to thy bark: i'll not be long beforei call upon thee.mariner:make your best haste, and go nottoo far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;besides, this place is famous for the creaturesof prey that keep upon't.antigonus:go thou away:i'll follow instantly.mariner:i am glad at heartto be so rid o' the business.antigonus:come, poor babe:i have heard, but not believed,the spirits o' the deadmay walk again: if such thing be, thy motherappear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dreamso like a waking. to me comes a creature,sometimes her head on one side, some another;i never saw a vessel of like sorrow,so fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,like very sanctity, she did approachmy cabin where i lay; thrice bow'd before me,and gasping to begin some speech, her eyesbecame two spouts: the fury spent, anondid this break-from her: 'good antigonus,since fate, against thy better disposition,hath made thy person for the thrower-outof my poor babe, according to thine oath,places remote enough are in bohemia,there weep and leave it crying; and, for the babeis counted lost for ever, perdita,i prithee, call't. for this ungentle businessput on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt seethy wife paulina more.' and so, with shrieksshe melted into air. affrighted much,i did in time collect myself and thoughtthis was so and no slumber. dreams are toys:yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,i will be squared by this. i do believehermione hath suffer'd death, and thatapollo would, this being indeed the issueof king polixenes, it should here be laid,either for life or death, upon the earthof its right father. blossom, speed thee well!there lie, and there thy character: there these;which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,and still rest thine. the storm begins; poor wretch,that for thy mother's fault art thus exposedto loss and what may follow! weep i cannot,but my heart bleeds; and most accursed am ito be by oath enjoin'd to this. farewell!the day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to havea lullaby too rough: i never sawthe heavens so dim by day. a savage clamour!well may i get aboard! this is the chase:i am gone for ever.shepherd:i would there were no age between sixteen andthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out therest; for there is nothing in the between butgetting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,stealing, fighting--hark you now! would any butthese boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twentyhunt this weather? they have scared away two of mybest sheep, which i fear the wolf will sooner findthan the master: if any where i have them, 'tis bythe seaside, browsing of ivy. good luck, an't be thywill what have we here! mercy on 's, a barne a verypretty barne! a boy or a child, i wonder? apretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:though i am not bookish, yet i can readwaiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. this has beensome stair-work, some trunk-work, somebehind-door-work: they were warmer that got thisthan the poor thing is here. i'll take it up forpity: yet i'll tarry till my son come; he hallooedbut even now. whoa, ho, hoa!clown:hilloa, loa!shepherd:what, art so near? if thou'lt see a thing to talkon when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. whatailest thou, man?clown:i have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!but i am not to say it is a sea, for it is now thesky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrusta bodkin's point.shepherd:why, boy, how is it?clown:i would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,how it takes up the shore! but that's not thepoint. o, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now theship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anonswallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust acork into a hogshead. and then for theland-service, to see how the bear tore out hisshoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and saidhis name was antigonus, a nobleman. but to make anend of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragonedit: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and thesea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roaredand the bear mocked him, both roaring louder thanthe sea or weather.shepherd:name of mercy, when was this, boy?clown:now, now: i have not winked since i saw thesesights: the men are not yet cold under water, northe bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at itnow.shepherd:would i had been by, to have helped the old man!clown:i would you had been by the ship side, to havehelped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.shepherd:heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,boy. now bless thyself: thou mettest with thingsdying, i with things newborn. here's a sight forthee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire'schild! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;open't. so, let's see: it was told me i should berich by the fairies. this is some changeling:open't. what's within, boy?clown:you're a made old man: if the sins of your youthare forgiven you, you're well to live. gold! all gold!shepherd:this is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: upwith't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.we are lucky, boy; and to be so still requiresnothing but secrecy. let my sheep go: come, goodboy, the next way home.clown:go you the next way with your findings. i'll go seeif the bear be gone from the gentleman and how muchhe hath eaten: they are never curst but when theyare hungry: if there be any of him left, i'll buryit.shepherd:that's a good deed. if thou mayest discern by thatwhich is left of him what he is, fetch me to thesight of him.clown:marry, will i; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.shepherd:'tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.time:i, that please some, try all, both joy and terrorof good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,now take upon me, in the name of time,to use my wings. impute it not a crimeto me or my swift passage, that i slideo'er sixteen years and leave the growth untriedof that wide gap, since it is in my powerto o'erthrow law and in one self-born hourto plant and o'erwhelm custom. let me passthe same i am, ere ancient'st order wasor what is now received: i witness tothe times that brought them in; so shall i doto the freshest things now reigning and make stalethe glistering of this present, as my talenow seems to it. your patience this allowing,i turn my glass and give my scene such growingas you had slept between: leontes leaving,the effects of his fond jealousies so grievingthat he shuts up himself, imagine me,gentle spectators, that i now may bein fair bohemia, and remember well,i mentioned a son o' the king's, which florizeli now name to you; and with speed so paceto speak of perdita, now grown in graceequal with wondering: what of her ensuesi list not prophecy; but let time's newsbe known when 'tis brought forth.a shepherd's daughter,and what to her adheres, which follows after,is the argument of time. of this allow,if ever you have spent time worse ere now;if never, yet that time himself doth sayhe wishes earnestly you never may.polixenes:i pray thee, good camillo, be no more importunate:'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death togrant this.camillo:it is fifteen years since i saw my country: thoughi have for the most part been aired abroad, idesire to lay my bones there. besides, the penitentking, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feelingsorrows i might be some allay, or i o'erween tothink so, which is another spur to my departure.polixenes:as thou lovest me, camillo, wipe not out the rest ofthy services by leaving me now: the need i have ofthee thine own goodness hath made; better not tohave had thee than thus to want thee: thou, havingmade me businesses which none without thee cansufficiently manage, must either stay to executethem thyself or take away with thee the veryservices thou hast done; which if i have not enoughconsidered, as too much i cannot, to be morethankful to thee shall be my study, and my profittherein the heaping friendships. of that fatalcountry, sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose verynaming punishes me with the remembrance of thatpenitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,my brother; whose loss of his most precious queenand children are even now to be afresh lamented.say to me, when sawest thou the prince florizel, myson? kings are no less unhappy, their issue notbeing gracious, than they are in losing them whenthey have approved their virtues.camillo:sir, it is three days since i saw the prince. whathis happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but ihave missingly noted, he is of late much retiredfrom court and is less frequent to his princelyexercises than formerly he hath appeared.polixenes:i have considered so much, camillo, and with somecare; so far that i have eyes under my service whichlook upon his removedness; from whom i have thisintelligence, that he is seldom from the house of amost homely shepherd; a man, they say, that fromvery nothing, and beyond the imagination of hisneighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.camillo:i have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath adaughter of most rare note: the report of her isextended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.polixenes:that's likewise part of my intelligence; but, ifear, the angle that plucks our son thither. thoushalt accompany us to the place; where we will, notappearing what we are, have some question with theshepherd; from whose simplicity i think it notuneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.prithee, be my present partner in this business, andlay aside the thoughts of sicilia.camillo:i willingly obey your command.polixenes:my best camillo! we must disguise ourselves.autolycus:when daffodils begin to peer,with heigh! the doxy over the dale,why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;for the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.the white sheet bleaching on the hedge,with heigh! the sweet birds, o, how they sing!doth set my pugging tooth on edge;for a quart of ale is a dish for a king.the lark, that tirra-lyra chants,with heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,are summer songs for me and my aunts,while we lie tumbling in the hay.i have served prince florizel and in my timewore three-pile; but now i am out of service:but shall i go mourn for that, my dear?the pale moon shines by night:and when i wander here and there,i then do most go right.if tinkers may have leave to live,and bear the sow-skin budget,then my account i well may, give,and in the stocks avouch it.my traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look tolesser linen. my father named me autolycus; whobeing, as i am, littered under mercury, was likewisea snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. with die anddrab i purchased this caparison, and my revenue isthe silly cheat. gallows and knock are too powerfulon the highway: beating and hanging are terrors tome: for the life to come, i sleep out the thoughtof it. a prize! a prize!clown:let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every todyields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundredshorn. what comes the wool to?autolycus:clown:i cannot do't without counters. let me see; what ami to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? three poundof sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what willthis sister of mine do with rice? but my fatherhath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays iton. she hath made me four and twenty nose-gays forthe shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very goodones; but they are most of them means and bases; butone puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms tohorn-pipes. i must have saffron to colour the wardenpies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that imay beg; four pound of prunes, and as many ofraisins o' the sun.autolycus:o that ever i was born!clown:i' the name of me--autolycus:o, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; andthen, death, death!clown:alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to layon thee, rather than have these off.autolycus:o sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me morethan the stripes i have received, which are mightyones and millions.clown:alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to agreat matter.autolycus:i am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparelta'en from me, and these detestable things put uponme.clown:what, by a horseman, or a footman?autolycus:a footman, sweet sir, a footman.clown:indeed, he should be a footman by the garments hehas left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,it hath seen very hot service. lend me thy hand,i'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.autolycus:o, good sir, tenderly, o!clown:alas, poor soul!autolycus:o, good sir, softly, good sir! i fear, sir, myshoulder-blade is out.clown:how now! canst stand?autolycus:clown:dost lack any money? i have a little money for thee.autolycus:no, good sweet sir; no, i beseech you, sir: i havea kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,unto whom i was going; i shall there have money, orany thing i want: offer me no money, i pray you;that kills my heart.clown:what manner of fellow was he that robbed you?autolycus:a fellow, sir, that i have known to go about withtroll-my-dames; i knew him once a servant of theprince: i cannot tell, good sir, for which of hisvirtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.clown:his vices, you would say; there's no virtue whippedout of the court: they cherish it to make it staythere; and yet it will no more but abide.autolycus:vices, i would say, sir. i know this man well: hehath been since an ape-bearer; then aprocess-server, a bailiff; then he compassed amotion of the prodigal son, and married a tinker'swife within a mile where my land and living lies;and, having flown over many knavish professions, hesettled only in rogue: some call him autolycus.clown:out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he hauntswakes, fairs and bear-baitings.autolycus:very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue thatput me into this apparel.clown:not a more cowardly rogue in all bohemia: if you hadbut looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.autolycus:i must confess to you, sir, i am no fighter: i amfalse of heart that way; and that he knew, i warranthim.clown:how do you now?autolycus:sweet sir, much better than i was; i can stand andwalk: i will even take my leave of you, and pacesoftly towards my kinsman's.clown:shall i bring thee on the way?autolycus:no, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.clown:then fare thee well: i must go buy spices for oursheep-shearing.autolycus:prosper you, sweet sir!your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.i'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if imake not this cheat bring out another and theshearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my nameput in the book of virtue!jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,and merrily hent the stile-a:a merry heart goes all the day,your sad tires in a mile-a.florizel:these your unusual weeds to each part of youdo give a life: no shepherdess, but florapeering in april's front. this your sheep-shearingis as a meeting of the petty gods,and you the queen on't.perdita:sir, my gracious lord,to chide at your extremes it not becomes me:o, pardon, that i name them! your high self,the gracious mark o' the land, you have obscuredwith a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feastsin every mess have folly and the feedersdigest it with a custom, i should blushto see you so attired, sworn, i think,to show myself a glass.florizel:i bless the timewhen my good falcon made her flight acrossthy father's ground.perdita:now jove afford you cause!to me the difference forges dread; your greatnesshath not been used to fear. even now i trembleto think your father, by some accident,should pass this way as you did: o, the fates!how would he look, to see his work so noblevilely bound up? what would he say? or howshould i, in these my borrow'd flaunts, beholdthe sternness of his presence?florizel:apprehendnothing but jollity. the gods themselves,humbling their deities to love, have takenthe shapes of beasts upon them: jupiterbecame a bull, and bellow'd; the green neptunea ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,golden apollo, a poor humble swain,as i seem now. their transformationswere never for a piece of beauty rarer,nor in a way so chaste, since my desiresrun not before mine honour, nor my lustsburn hotter than my faith.perdita:o, but, sir,your resolution cannot hold, when 'tisopposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:one of these two must be necessities,which then will speak, that you mustchange this purpose,or i my life.florizel:thou dearest perdita,with these forced thoughts, i prithee, darken notthe mirth o' the feast. or i'll be thine, my fair,or not my father's. for i cannot bemine own, nor any thing to any, ifi be not thine. to this i am most constant,though destiny say no. be merry, gentle;strangle such thoughts as these with any thingthat you behold the while. your guests are coming:lift up your countenance, as it were the dayof celebration of that nuptial whichwe two have sworn shall come.perdita:o lady fortune,stand you auspicious!florizel:see, your guests approach:address yourself to entertain them sprightly,and let's be red with mirth.shepherd:fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, uponthis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,at upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;on his shoulder, and his; her face o' firewith labour and the thing she took to quench it,she would to each one sip. you are retired,as if you were a feasted one and notthe hostess of the meeting: pray you, bidthese unknown friends to's welcome; for it isa way to make us better friends, more known.come, quench your blushes and present yourselfthat which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,and bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,as your good flock shall prosper.perdita:polixenes:shepherdess,a fair one are you--well you fit our ageswith flowers of winter.perdita:sir, the year growing ancient,not yet on summer's death, nor on the birthof trembling winter, the fairestflowers o' the seasonare our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,which some call nature's bastards: of that kindour rustic garden's barren; and i care notto get slips of them.polixenes:wherefore, gentle maiden,do you neglect them?perdita:for i have heard it saidthere is an art which in their piedness shareswith great creating nature.polixenes:say there be;yet nature is made better by no meanbut nature makes that mean: so, over that artwhich you say adds to nature, is an artthat nature makes. you see, sweet maid, we marrya gentler scion to the wildest stock,and make conceive a bark of baser kindby bud of nobler race: this is an artwhich does mend nature, change it rather, butthe art itself is nature.perdita:so it is.polixenes:then make your garden rich in gillyvors,and do not call them bastards.perdita:i'll not putthe dibble in earth to set one slip of them;no more than were i painted i would wishthis youth should say 'twere well and only thereforedesire to breed by me. here's flowers for you;hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;the marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sunand with him rises weeping: these are flowersof middle summer, and i think they are givento men of middle age. you're very welcome.camillo:i should leave grazing, were i of your flock,and only live by gazing.perdita:out, alas!you'd be so lean, that blasts of januarywould blow you through and through.now, my fair'st friend,i would i had some flowers o' the spring that mightbecome your time of day; and yours, and yours,that wear upon your virgin branches yetyour maidenheads growing: o proserpina,for the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fallfrom dis's waggon! daffodils,that come before the swallow dares, and takethe winds of march with beauty; violets dim,but sweeter than the lids of juno's eyesor cytherea's breath; pale primrosesthat die unmarried, ere they can beholdbight phoebus in his strength--a maladymost incident to maids; bold oxlips andthe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,the flower-de-luce being one! o, these i lack,to make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,to strew him o'er and o'er!florizel:what, like a corse?perdita:no, like a bank for love to lie and play on;not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,but quick and in mine arms. come, take your flowers:methinks i play as i have seen them doin whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of minedoes change my disposition.florizel:what you dostill betters what is done. when you speak, sweet.i'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,i'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,to sing them too: when you do dance, i wish youa wave o' the sea, that you might ever donothing but that; move still, still so,and own no other function: each your doing,so singular in each particular,crowns what you are doing in the present deed,that all your acts are queens.perdita:o doricles,your praises are too large: but that your youth,and the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,with wisdom i might fear, my doricles,you woo'd me the false way.florizel:i think you haveas little skill to fear as i have purposeto put you to't. but come; our dance, i pray:your hand, my perdita: so turtles pair,that never mean to part.perdita:i'll swear for 'em.polixenes:this is the prettiest low-born lass that everran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seemsbut smacks of something greater than herself,too noble for this place.camillo:he tells her somethingthat makes her blood look out: good sooth, she isthe queen of curds and cream.clown:come on, strike up!dorcas:mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,to mend her kissing with!mopsa:now, in good time!clown:not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.come, strike up!polixenes:pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is thiswhich dances with your daughter?shepherd:they call him doricles; and boasts himselfto have a worthy feeding: but i have itupon his own report and i believe it;he looks like sooth. he says he loves my daughter:i think so too; for never gazed the moonupon the water as he'll stand and readas 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.i think there is not half a kiss to choosewho loves another best.polixenes:she dances featly.shepherd:so she does any thing; though i report it,that should be silent: if young doriclesdo light upon her, she shall bring him thatwhich he not dreams of.servant:o master, if you did but hear the pedlar at thedoor, you would never dance again after a tabour andpipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he singsseveral tunes faster than you'll tell money; heutters them as he had eaten ballads and all men'sears grew to his tunes.clown:he could never come better; he shall come in. ilove a ballad but even too well, if it be dolefulmatter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thingindeed and sung lamentably.servant:he hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; nomilliner can so fit his customers with gloves: hehas the prettiest love-songs for maids; so withoutbawdry, which is strange; with such delicateburthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thumpher;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap intothe matter, he makes the maid to answer 'whoop, do meno harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with'whoop, do me no harm, good man.'polixenes:this is a brave fellow.clown:believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceitedfellow. has he any unbraided wares?servant:he hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;points more than all the lawyers in bohemia canlearnedly handle, though they come to him by thegross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, hesings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; youwould think a smock were a she-angel, he so chantsto the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.clown:prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.perdita:forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.clown:you have of these pedlars, that have more in themthan you'ld think, sister.perdita:ay, good brother, or go about to think.autolycus:lawn as white as driven snow;cyprus black as e'er was crow;gloves as sweet as damask roses;masks for faces and for noses;bugle bracelet, necklace amber,perfume for a lady's chamber;golden quoifs and stomachers,for my lads to give their dears:pins and poking-sticks of steel,what maids lack from head to heel:come buy of me, come;

some say he shall be stoned; but that deathis too soft for him, say i draw our throne into asheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.clown:has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an'tlike you, sir?autolycus:he has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then'nointed over with honey, set on the head of awasp's nest; then stand till he be three quartersand a dram dead; then recovered again withaqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw ashe is, and in the hottest day prognosticationproclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, thesun looking with a southward eye upon him, where heis to behold him with flies blown to death. but whattalk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseriesare to be smiled at, their offences being socapital? tell me, for you seem to be honest plainmen, what you have to the king: being somethinggently considered, i'll bring you where he isaboard, tender your persons to his presence,whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in manbesides the king to effect your suits, here is manshall do it.clown:he seems to be of great authority: close with him,give him gold; and though authority be a stubbornbear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: showthe inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,and no more ado. remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'shepherd:an't please you, sir, to undertake the business forus, here is that gold i have: i'll make it as muchmore and leave this young man in pawn till i bring it you.autolycus:after i have done what i promised?shepherd:ay, sir.autolycus:well, give me the moiety. are you a party in this business?clown:in some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitifulone, i hope i shall not be flayed out of it.autolycus:o, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,he'll be made an example.clown:comfort, good comfort! we must to the king and showour strange sights: he must know 'tis none of yourdaughter nor my sister; we are gone else. sir, iwill give you as much as this old man does when thebusiness is performed, and remain, as he says, yourpawn till it be brought you.autolycus:i will trust you. walk before toward the sea-side;go on the right hand: i will but look upon thehedge and follow you.clown:we are blest in this man, as i may say, even blest.shepherd:let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.autolycus:if i had a mind to be honest, i see fortune wouldnot suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. i amcourted now with a double occasion, gold and a meansto do the prince my master good; which who knows howthat may turn back to my advancement? i will bringthese two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if hethink it fit to shore them again and that thecomplaint they have to the king concerns himnothing, let him call me rogue for being so farofficious; for i am proof against that title andwhat shame else belongs to't. to him will i presentthem: there may be matter in it.cleomenes:sir, you have done enough, and have perform'da saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid downmore penitence than done trespass: at the last,do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;with them forgive yourself.leontes:whilst i rememberher and her virtues, i cannot forgetmy blemishes in them, and so still think ofthe wrong i did myself; which was so much,that heirless it hath made my kingdom anddestroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er manbred his hopes out of.paulina:true, too true, my lord:if, one by one, you wedded all the world,or from the all that are took something good,to make a perfect woman, she you kill'dwould be unparallel'd.leontes:i think so. kill'd!she i kill'd! i did so: but thou strikest mesorely, to say i did; it is as bitterupon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,say so but seldom.cleomenes:not at all, good lady:you might have spoken a thousand things that wouldhave done the time more benefit and gracedyour kindness better.paulina:you are one of thosewould have him wed again.dion:if you would not so,you pity not the state, nor the remembranceof his most sovereign name; consider littlewhat dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,may drop upon his kingdom and devourincertain lookers on. what were more holythan to rejoice the former queen is well?what holier than, for royalty's repair,for present comfort and for future good,to bless the bed of majesty againwith a sweet fellow to't?paulina:there is none worthy,respecting her that's gone. besides, the godswill have fulfill'd their secret purposes;for has not the divine apollo said,is't not the tenor of his oracle,that king leontes shall not have an heirtill his lost child be found? which that it shall,is all as monstrous to our human reasonas my antigonus to break his graveand come again to me; who, on my life,did perish with the infant. 'tis your counselmy lord should to the heavens be contrary,oppose against their wills.care not for issue;the crown will find an heir: great alexanderleft his to the worthiest; so his successorwas like to be the best.leontes:good paulina,who hast the memory of hermione,i know, in honour, o, that ever ihad squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,i might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,have taken treasure from her lips--paulina:and left themmore rich for what they yielded.leontes:thou speak'st truth.no more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,and better used, would make her sainted spiritagain possess her corpse, and on this stage,where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,and begin, 'why to me?'paulina:had she such power,she had just cause.leontes:she had; and would incense meto murder her i married.paulina:i should so.were i the ghost that walk'd, i'ld bid you markher eye, and tell me for what dull part in'tyou chose her; then i'ld shriek, that even your earsshould rift to hear me; and the words that follow'dshould be 'remember mine.'leontes:stars, stars,and all eyes else dead coals! fear thou no wife;i'll have no wife, paulina.paulina:will you swearnever to marry but by my free leave?leontes:never, paulina; so be blest my spirit!paulina:then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.cleomenes:you tempt him over-much.paulina:unless another,as like hermione as is her picture,affront his eye.cleomenes:good madam,--paulina:i have done.yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,no remedy, but you will,--give me the officeto choose you a queen: she shall not be so youngas was your former; but she shall be suchas, walk'd your first queen's ghost,it should take joyto see her in your arms.leontes:my true paulina,we shall not marry till thou bid'st us.paulina:thatshall be when your first queen's again in breath;never till then.gentleman:one that gives out himself prince florizel,son of polixenes, with his princess, shethe fairest i have yet beheld, desires accessto your high presence.leontes:what with him? he comes notlike to his father's greatness: his approach,so out of circumstance and sudden, tells us'tis not a visitation framed, but forcedby need and accident. what train?gentleman:but few,and those but mean.leontes:his princess, say you, with him?gentleman:ay, the most peerless piece of earth, i think,that e'er the sun shone bright on.paulina:o hermione,as every present time doth boast itselfabove a better gone, so must thy gravegive way to what's seen now! sir, you yourselfhave said and writ so, but your writing nowis colder than that theme, 'she had not been,nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verseflow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,to say you have seen a better.gentleman:pardon, madam:the one i have almost forgot,--your pardon,--the other, when she has obtain'd your eye,will have your tongue too. this is a creature,would she begin a sect, might quench the zealof all professors else, make proselytesof who she but bid follow.paulina:how! not women?gentleman:women will love her, that she is a womanmore worth than any man; men, that she isthe rarest of all women.leontes:go, cleomenes;yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,bring them to our embracement. still, 'tis strangehe thus should steal upon us.paulina:had our prince,jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'dwell with this lord: there was not full a monthbetween their births.leontes:prithee, no more; cease; thou know'sthe dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,when i shall see this gentleman, thy speecheswill bring me to consider that which mayunfurnish me of reason. they are come.your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;for she did print your royal father off,conceiving you: were i but twenty-one,your father's image is so hit in you,his very air, that i should call you brother,as i did him, and speak of something wildlyby us perform'd before. most dearly welcome!and your fair princess,--goddess!--o, alas!i lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earthmight thus have stood begetting wonder asyou, gracious couple, do: and then i lost--all mine own folly--the society,amity too, of your brave father, whom,though bearing misery, i desire my lifeonce more to look on him.florizel:by his commandhave i here touch'd sicilia and from himgive you all greetings that a king, at friend,can send his brother: and, but infirmitywhich waits upon worn times hath something seizedhis wish'd ability, he had himselfthe lands and waters 'twixt your throne and hismeasured to look upon you; whom he loves--he bade me say so--more than all the sceptresand those that bear them living.leontes:o my brother,good gentleman! the wrongs i have done thee stirafresh within me, and these thy offices,so rarely kind, are as interpretersof my behind-hand slackness. welcome hither,as is the spring to the earth. and hath he tooexposed this paragon to the fearful usage,at least ungentle, of the dreadful neptune,to greet a man not worth her pains, much lessthe adventure of her person?florizel:good my lord,she came from libya.leontes:where the warlike smalus,that noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?florizel:most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughterhis tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,a prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,to execute the charge my father gave mefor visiting your highness: my best traini have from your sicilian shores dismiss'd;who for bohemia bend, to signifynot only my success in libya, sir,but my arrival and my wife's in safetyhere where we are.leontes:the blessed godspurge all infection from our air whilst youdo climate here! you have a holy father,a graceful gentleman; against whose person,so sacred as it is, i have done sin:for which the heavens, taking angry note,have left me issueless; and your father's blest,as he from heaven merits it, with youworthy his goodness. what might i have been,might i a son and daughter now have look'd on,such goodly things as you!lord:most noble sir,that which i shall report will bear no credit,were not the proof so nigh. please you, great sir,bohemia greets you from himself by me;desires you to attach his son, who has--his dignity and duty both cast off--fled from his father, from his hopes, and witha shepherd's daughter.leontes:where's bohemia? speak.lord:here in your city; i now came from him:i speak amazedly; and it becomesmy marvel and my message. to your courtwhiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,of this fair couple, meets he on the waythe father of this seeming lady andher brother, having both their country quittedwith this young prince.florizel:camillo has betray'd me;whose honour and whose honesty till nowendured all weathers.lord:lay't so to his charge:he's with the king your father.leontes:who? camillo?lord:camillo, sir; i spake with him; who nowhas these poor men in question. never saw iwretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;forswear themselves as often as they speak:bohemia stops his ears, and threatens themwith divers deaths in death.perdita:o my poor father!the heaven sets spies upon us, will not haveour contract celebrated.leontes:you are married?florizel:we are not, sir, nor are we like to be;the stars, i see, will kiss the valleys first:the odds for high and low's alike.leontes:my lord,is this the daughter of a king?florizel:she is,when once she is my wife.leontes:that 'once' i see by your good father's speedwill come on very slowly. i am sorry,most sorry, you have broken from his likingwhere you were tied in duty, and as sorryyour choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,that you might well enjoy her.florizel:dear, look up:though fortune, visible an enemy,should chase us with my father, power no jothath she to change our loves. beseech you, sir,remember since you owed no more to timethan i do now: with thought of such affections,step forth mine advocate; at your requestmy father will grant precious things as trifles.leontes:would he do so, i'ld beg your precious mistress,which he counts but a trifle.paulina:sir, my liege,your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month'fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazesthan what you look on now.leontes:i thought of her,even in these looks i made.but your petitionis yet unanswer'd. i will to your father:your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,i am friend to them and you: upon which errandi now go toward him; therefore follow meand mark what way i make: come, good my lord.autolycus:beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?first gentleman:i was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the oldshepherd deliver the manner how he found it:whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were allcommanded out of the chamber; only this methought iheard the shepherd say, he found the child.autolycus:i would most gladly know the issue of it.first gentleman:i make a broken delivery of the business; but thechanges i perceived in the king and camillo werevery notes of admiration: they seemed almost, withstaring on one another, to tear the cases of theireyes; there was speech in their dumbness, languagein their very gesture; they looked as they had heardof a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notablepassion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisestbeholder, that knew no more but seeing, could notsay if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in theextremity of the one, it must needs be.here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.the news, rogero?second gentleman:nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; theking's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder isbroken out within this hour that ballad-makerscannot be able to express it.here comes the lady paulina's steward: he candeliver you more. how goes it now, sir? this newswhich is called true is so like an old tale, thatthe verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the kingfound his heir?third gentleman:most true, if ever truth were pregnant bycircumstance: that which you hear you'll swear yousee, there is such unity in the proofs. the mantleof queen hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,the letters of antigonus found with it which theyknow to be his character, the majesty of thecreature in resemblance of the mother, the affectionof nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,and many other evidences proclaim her with allcertainty to be the king's daughter. did you seethe meeting of the two kings?second gentleman:no.third gentleman:then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,cannot be spoken of. there might you have beheld onejoy crown another, so and in such manner that itseemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for theirjoy waded in tears. there was casting up of eyes,holding up of hands, with countenances of suchdistraction that they were to be known by garment,not by favour. our king, being ready to leap out ofhimself for joy of his found daughter, as if thatjoy were now become a loss, cries 'o, thy mother,thy mother!' then asks bohemia forgiveness; thenembraces his son-in-law; then again worries he hisdaughter with clipping her; now he thanks the oldshepherd, which stands by like a weather-bittenconduit of many kings' reigns. i never heard of suchanother encounter, which lames report to follow itand undoes description to do it.second gentleman:what, pray you, became of antigonus, that carriedhence the child?third gentleman:like an old tale still, which will have matter torehearse, though credit be asleep and not an earopen. he was torn to pieces with a bear: thisavouches the shepherd's son; who has not only hisinnocence, which seems much, to justify him, but ahandkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows.first gentleman:what became of his bark and his followers?third gentleman:wrecked the same instant of their master's death andin the view of the shepherd: so that all theinstruments which aided to expose the child wereeven then lost when it was found. but o, the noblecombat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought inpaulina! she had one eye declined for the loss ofher husband, another elevated that the oracle wasfulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pinher to her heart that she might no more be in dangerof losing.first gentleman:the dignity of this act was worth the audience ofkings and princes; for by such was it acted.third gentleman:one of the prettiest touches of all and that whichangled for mine eyes, caught the water though notthe fish, was when, at the relation of the queen'sdeath, with the manner how she came to't bravelyconfessed and lamented by the king, howattentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from onesign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'alas,'i would fain say, bleed tears, for i am sure myheart wept blood. who was most marble there changedcolour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the worldcould have seen 't, the woe had been universal.first gentleman:are they returned to the court?third gentleman:no: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,which is in the keeping of paulina,--a piece manyyears in doing and now newly performed by that rareitalian master, julio romano, who, had he himselfeternity and could put breath into his work, wouldbeguile nature of her custom, so perfectly he is herape: he so near to hermione hath done hermione thatthey say one would speak to her and stand in hope ofanswer: thither with all greediness of affectionare they gone, and there they intend to sup.second gentleman:i thought she had some great matter there in hand;for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, eversince the death of hermione, visited that removedhouse. shall we thither and with our company piecethe rejoicing?first gentleman:who would be thence that has the benefit of access?every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.let's along.autolycus:now, had i not the dash of my former life in me,would preferment drop on my head. i brought the oldman and his son aboard the prince: told him i heardthem talk of a fardel and i know not what: but heat that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,so he then took her to be, who began to be muchsea-sick, and himself little better, extremity ofweather continuing, this mystery remainedundiscovered. but 'tis all one to me; for had ibeen the finder out of this secret, it would nothave relished among my other discredits.here come those i have done good to against my will,and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.shepherd:come, boy; i am past moe children, but thy sons anddaughters will be all gentlemen born.clown:you are well met, sir. you denied to fight with methis other day, because i was no gentleman born.see you these clothes? say you see them not andthink me still no gentleman born: you were best saythese robes are not gentlemen born: give me thelie, do, and try whether i am not now a gentleman born.autolycus:i know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.clown:ay, and have been so any time these four hours.shepherd:and so have i, boy.clown:so you have: but i was a gentleman born before myfather; for the king's son took me by the hand, andcalled me brother; and then the two kings called myfather brother; and then the prince my brother andthe princess my sister called my father father; andso we wept, and there was the first gentleman-liketears that ever we shed.shepherd:we may live, son, to shed many more.clown:ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in sopreposterous estate as we are.autolycus:i humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all thefaults i have committed to your worship and to giveme your good report to the prince my master.shepherd:prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we aregentlemen.clown:thou wilt amend thy life?autolycus:ay, an it like your good worship.clown:give me thy hand: i will swear to the prince thouart as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia.shepherd:you may say it, but not swear it.clown:not swear it, now i am a gentleman? let boors andfranklins say it, i'll swear it.shepherd:how if it be false, son?clown:if it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swearit in the behalf of his friend: and i'll swear tothe prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands andthat thou wilt not be drunk; but i know thou art notall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt bedrunk: but i'll swear it, and i would thou wouldstbe a tall fellow of thy hands.autolycus:i will prove so, sir, to my power.clown:ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if i do notwonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, notbeing a tall fellow, trust me not. hark! the kingsand the princes, our kindred, are going to see thequeen's picture. come, follow us: we'll be thygood masters.leontes:o grave and good paulina, the great comfortthat i have had of thee!paulina:what, sovereign sir,i did not well i meant well. all my servicesyou have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,with your crown'd brother and these your contractedheirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,it is a surplus of your grace, which nevermy life may last to answer.leontes:o paulina,we honour you with trouble: but we cameto see the statue of our queen: your galleryhave we pass'd through, not without much contentin many singularities; but we saw notthat which my daughter came to look upon,the statue of her mother.paulina:as she lived peerless,so her dead likeness, i do well believe,excels whatever yet you look'd uponor hand of man hath done; therefore i keep itlonely, apart. but here it is: prepareto see the life as lively mock'd as everstill sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.i like your silence, it the more shows offyour wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,comes it not something near?leontes:her natural posture!chide me, dear stone, that i may say indeedthou art hermione; or rather, thou art shein thy not chiding, for she was as tenderas infancy and grace. but yet, paulina,hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothingso aged as this seems.polixenes:o, not by much.paulina:so much the more our carver's excellence;which lets go by some sixteen years and makes heras she lived now.leontes:as now she might have done,so much to my good comfort, as it isnow piercing to my soul. o, thus she stood,even with such life of majesty, warm life,as now it coldly stands, when first i woo'd her!i am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke mefor being more stone than it? o royal piece,there's magic in thy majesty, which hasmy evils conjured to remembrance andfrom thy admiring daughter took the spirits,standing like stone with thee.perdita:and give me leave,and do not say 'tis superstition, thati kneel and then implore her blessing. lady,dear queen, that ended when i but began,give me that hand of yours to kiss.paulina:o, patience!the statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's not dry.camillo:my lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,which sixteen winters cannot blow away,so many summers dry; scarce any joydid ever so long live; no sorrowbut kill'd itself much sooner.polixenes:dear my brother,let him that was the cause of this have powerto take off so much grief from you as hewill piece up in himself.paulina:indeed, my lord,if i had thought the sight of my poor imagewould thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--i'ld not have show'd it.leontes:do not draw the curtain.paulina:no longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancymay think anon it moves.leontes:let be, let be.would i were dead, but that, methinks, already--what was he that did make it? see, my lord,would you not deem it breathed? and that those veinsdid verily bear blood?polixenes:masterly done:the very life seems warm upon her lip.leontes:the fixture of her eye has motion in't,as we are mock'd with art.paulina:i'll draw the curtain:my lord's almost so far transported thathe'll think anon it lives.leontes:o sweet paulina,make me to think so twenty years together!no settled senses of the world can matchthe pleasure of that madness. let 't alone.paulina:i am sorry, sir, i have thus far stirr'd you: buti could afflict you farther.leontes:do, paulina;for this affliction has a taste as sweetas any cordial comfort. still, methinks,there is an air comes from her: what fine chiselcould ever yet cut breath? let no man mock me,for i will kiss her.paulina:good my lord, forbear:the ruddiness upon her lip is wet;you'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your ownwith oily painting. shall i draw the curtain?leontes:no, not these twenty years.perdita:so long could istand by, a looker on.paulina:either forbear,quit presently the chapel, or resolve youfor more amazement. if you can behold it,i'll make the statue move indeed, descendand take you by the hand; but then you'll think--which i protest against--i am assistedby wicked powers.leontes:what you can make her do,i am content to look on: what to speak,i am content to hear; for 'tis as easyto make her speak as move.paulina:it is requiredyou do awake your faith. then all stand still;on: those that think it is unlawful businessi am about, let them depart.leontes:proceed:no foot shall stir.paulina:music, awake her; strike!'tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;strike all that look upon with marvel. come,i'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,bequeath to death your numbness, for from himdear life redeems you. you perceive she stirs:start not; her actions shall be holy asyou hear my spell is lawful: do not shun heruntil you see her die again; for thenyou kill her double. nay, present your hand:when she was young you woo'd her; now in ageis she become the suitor?leontes:o, she's warm!if this be magic, let it be an artlawful as eating.polixenes:she embraces him.camillo:she hangs about his neck:if she pertain to life let her speak too.polixenes:ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,or how stolen from the dead.paulina:that she is living,were it but told you, should be hooted atlike an old tale: but it appears she lives,though yet she speak not. mark a little while.please you to interpose, fair madam: kneeland pray your mother's blessing. turn, good lady;our perdita is found.hermione:you gods, look downand from your sacred vials pour your gracesupon my daughter's head! tell me, mine own.where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how foundthy father's court? for thou shalt hear that i,knowing by paulina that the oraclegave hope thou wast in being, have preservedmyself to see the issue.paulina:there's time enough for that;lest they desire upon this push to troubleyour joys with like relation. go together,you precious winners all; your exultationpartake to every one. i, an old turtle,will wing me to some wither'd bough and theremy mate, that's never to be found again,lament till i am lost.leontes:o, peace, paulina!thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,as i by thine a wife: this is a match,and made between's by vows. thou hast found mine;but how, is to be question'd; for i saw her,as i thought, dead, and have in vain said manya prayer upon her grave. i'll not seek far--for him, i partly know his mind--to find theean honourable husband. come, camillo,and take her by the hand, whose worth and honestyis richly noted and here justifiedby us, a pair of kings. let's from this place.what! look upon my brother: both your pardons,that e'er i put between your holy looksmy ill suspicion. this is your son-in-law,and son unto the king, who, heavens directing,is troth-plight to your daughter. good paulina,lead us from hence, where we may leisurelyeach one demand an answer to his partperform'd in this wide gap of time since firstwe were dissever'd: hastily lead away.duke vincentio:escalus.escalus:my lord.duke vincentio:of government the properties to unfold,would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;since i am put to know that your own scienceexceeds, in that, the lists of all advicemy strength can give you: then no more remains,but that to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,and let them work. the nature of our people,our city's institutions, and the termsfor common justice, you're as pregnant inas art and practise hath enriched anythat we remember. there is our commission,from which we would not have you warp. call hither,i say, bid come before us angelo.what figure of us think you he will bear?for you must know, we have with special soulelected him our absence to supply,lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,and given his deputation all the organsof our own power: what think you of it?escalus:if any in vienna be of worthto undergo such ample grace and honour,it is lord angelo.duke vincentio:look where he comes.angelo:always obedient to your grace's will,i come to know your pleasure.duke vincentio:angelo,there is a kind of character in thy life,that to the observer doth thy historyfully unfold. thyself and thy belongingsare not thine own so proper as to wastethyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.heaven doth with us as we with torches do,not light them for themselves; for if our virtuesdid not go forth of us, 'twere all alikeas if we had them not. spirits are not finely touch'dbut to fine issues, nor nature never lendsthe smallest scruple of her excellencebut, like a thrifty goddess, she determinesherself the glory of a creditor,both thanks and use. but i do bend my speechto one that can my part in him advertise;hold therefore, angelo:--in our remove be thou at full ourself;mortality and mercy in viennalive in thy tongue and heart: old escalus,though first in question, is thy secondary.take thy commission.angelo:now, good my lord,let there be some more test made of my metal,before so noble and so great a figurebe stamp'd upon it.duke vincentio:no more evasion:we have with a leaven'd and prepared choiceproceeded to you;

and it concerns meto look into the bottom of my place:a power i have, but of what strength and naturei am not yet instructed.angelo:'tis so with me. let us withdraw together,and we may soon our satisfaction havetouching that point.escalus:i'll wait upon your honour.lucio:if the duke with the other dukes come not tocomposition with the king of hungary, why then allthe dukes fall upon the king.first gentleman:heaven grant us its peace, but not the king ofhungary's!second gentleman:amen.lucio:thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, thatwent to sea with the ten commandments, but scrapedone out of the table.second gentleman:'thou shalt not steal'?lucio:ay, that he razed.first gentleman:why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain andall the rest from their functions: they put forthto steal. there's not a soldier of us all, that, inthe thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petitionwell that prays for peace.second gentleman:i never heard any soldier dislike it.lucio:i believe thee; for i think thou never wast wheregrace was said.second gentleman:no? a dozen times at least.first gentleman:what, in metre?lucio:in any proportion or in any language.first gentleman:i think, or in any religion.lucio:ay, why not? grace is grace, despite of allcontroversy: as, for example, thou thyself art awicked villain, despite of all grace.first gentleman:well, there went but a pair of shears between us.lucio:i grant; as there may between the lists and thevelvet. thou art the list.first gentleman:and thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rta three-piled piece, i warrant thee: i had as liefbe a list of an english kersey as be piled, as thouart piled, for a french velvet. do i speakfeelingly now?lucio:i think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painfulfeeling of thy speech: i will, out of thine ownconfession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst ilive, forget to drink after thee.first gentleman:i think i have done myself wrong, have i not?second gentleman:yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.lucio:behold, behold. where madam mitigation comes! ihave purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--second gentleman:to what, i pray?lucio:judge.second gentleman:to three thousand dolours a year.first gentleman:ay, and more.lucio:a french crown more.first gentleman:thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thouart full of error; i am sound.lucio:nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound asthings that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;impiety has made a feast of thee.first gentleman:how now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?mistress overdone:well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carriedto prison was worth five thousand of you all.second gentleman:who's that, i pray thee?mistress overdone:marry, sir, that's claudio, signior claudio.first gentleman:claudio to prison? 'tis not so.mistress overdone:nay, but i know 'tis so: i saw him arrested, sawhim carried away; and, which is more, within thesethree days his head to be chopped off.lucio:but, after all this fooling, i would not have it so.art thou sure of this?mistress overdone:i am too sure of it: and it is for getting madamjulietta with child.lucio:believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me twohours since, and he was ever precise inpromise-keeping.second gentleman:besides, you know, it draws something near to thespeech we had to such a purpose.first gentleman:but, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.lucio:away! let's go learn the truth of it.mistress overdone:thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, whatwith the gallows and what with poverty, i amcustom-shrunk.how now! what's the news with you?pompey:yonder man is carried to prison.mistress overdone:well;

fear you not: good counsellors lack noclients: though you change your place, you need notchange your trade; i'll be your tapster still.courage! there will be pity taken on you: you thathave worn your eyes almost out in the service, youwill be considered.mistress overdone:what's to do here, thomas tapster? let's withdraw.pompey:here comes signior claudio, led by the provost toprison; and there's madam juliet.claudio:fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?bear me to prison, where i am committed.provost:i do it not in evil disposition,but from lord angelo by special charge.claudio:thus can the demigod authoritymake us pay down for our offence by weightthe words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;on whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.lucio:why, how now, claudio! whence comes this restraint?claudio:from too much liberty, my lucio, liberty:as surfeit is the father of much fast,so every scope by the immoderate useturns to restraint. our natures do pursue,like rats that ravin down their proper bane,a thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.lucio:if could speak so wisely under an arrest, i wouldsend for certain of my creditors: and yet, to saythe truth, i had as lief have the foppery of freedomas the morality of imprisonment. what's thyoffence, claudio?claudio:what but to speak of would offend again.lucio:what, is't murder?claudio:no.lucio:lechery?claudio:call it so.provost:away, sir! you must go.claudio:one word, good friend. lucio, a word with you.lucio:a hundred, if they'll do you any good.is lechery so look'd after?claudio:thus stands it with me: upon a true contracti got possession of julietta's bed:you know the lady; she is fast my wife,save that we do the denunciation lackof outward order: this we came not to,only for propagation of a dowerremaining in the coffer of her friends,from whom we thought it meet to hide our lovetill time had made them for us. but it chancesthe stealth of our most mutual entertainmentwith character too gross is writ on juliet.lucio:with child, perhaps?claudio:unhappily, even so.and the new deputy now for the duke--whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,or whether that the body public bea horse whereon the governor doth ride,who, newly in the seat, that it may knowhe can command, lets it straight feel the spur;whether the tyranny be in his place,or in his emmence that fills it up,i stagger in:--but this new governorawakes me all the enrolled penaltieswhich have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wallso long that nineteen zodiacs have gone roundand none of them been worn; and, for a name,now puts the drowsy and neglected actfreshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.lucio:i warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle onthy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,may sigh it off. send after the duke and appeal tohim.claudio:i have done so, but he's not to be found.i prithee, lucio, do me this kind service:this day my sister should the cloister enterand there receive her approbation:acquaint her with the danger of my state:implore her, in my voice, that she make friendsto the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:i have great hope in that; for in her youththere is a prone and speechless dialect,such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous artwhen she will play with reason and discourse,and well she can persuade.lucio:i pray she may; as well for the encouragement of thelike, which else would stand under grievousimposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who iwould be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at agame of tick-tack. i'll to her.claudio:i thank you, good friend lucio.lucio:within two hours.claudio:come, officer, away!duke vincentio:no, holy father; throw away that thought;believe not that the dribbling dart of lovecan pierce a complete bosom. why i desire theeto give me secret harbour, hath a purposemore grave and wrinkled than the aims and endsof burning youth.friar thomas:may your grace speak of it?duke vincentio:my holy sir, none better knows than youhow i have ever loved the life removedand held in idle price to haunt assemblieswhere youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.i have deliver'd to lord angelo,a man of stricture and firm abstinence,my absolute power and place here in vienna,and he supposes me travell'd to poland;for so i have strew'd it in the common ear,and so it is received. now, pious sir,you will demand of me why i do this?friar thomas:gladly, my lord.duke vincentio:we have strict statutes and most biting laws.the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,which for this nineteen years we have let slip;even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,that goes not out to prey. now, as fond fathers,having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,only to stick it in their children's sightfor terror, not to use, in time the rodbecomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;and liberty plucks justice by the nose;the baby beats the nurse, and quite athwartgoes all decorum.friar thomas:it rested in your graceto unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:and it in you more dreadful would have seem'dthan in lord angelo.duke vincentio:i do fear, too dreadful:sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,'twould be my tyranny to strike and gall themfor what i bid them do: for we bid this be done,when evil deeds have their permissive passand not the punishment. therefore indeed, my father,i have on angelo imposed the office;who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,and yet my nature never in the fightto do in slander. and to behold his sway,i will, as 'twere a brother of your order,visit both prince and people: therefore, i prithee,supply me with the habit and instruct mehow i may formally in person bear melike a true friar. more reasons for this actionat our more leisure shall i render you;only, this one: lord angelo is precise;stands at a guard with envy; scarce confessesthat his blood flows, or that his appetiteis more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,if power change purpose, what our seemers be.isabella:and have you nuns no farther privileges?francisca:are not these large enough?isabella:yes, truly; i speak not as desiring more;but rather wishing a more strict restraintupon the sisterhood, the votarists of saint clare.lucio:isabella:who's that which calls?francisca:it is a man's voice. gentle isabella,turn you the key, and know his business of him;you may, i may not; you are yet unsworn.when you have vow'd, you must not speak with menbut in the presence of the prioress:then, if you speak, you must not show your face,or, if you show your face, you must not speak.he calls again; i pray you, answer him.isabella:peace and prosperity! who is't that callslucio:hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-rosesproclaim you are no less! can you so stead meas bring me to the sight of isabella,a novice of this place and the fair sisterto her unhappy brother claudio?isabella:why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,the rather for i now must make you knowi am that isabella and his sister.lucio:gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:not to be weary with you, he's in prison.isabella:woe me! for what?lucio:for that which, if myself might be his judge,he should receive his punishment in thanks:he hath got his friend with child.isabella:sir, make me not your story.lucio:it is true.i would not--though 'tis my familiar sinwith maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:i hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.by your renouncement an immortal spirit,and to be talk'd with in sincerity,as with a saint.isabella:you do blaspheme the good in mocking me.lucio:do not believe it. fewness and truth, 'tis thus:your brother and his lover have embraced:as those that feed grow full, as blossoming timethat from the seedness the bare fallow bringsto teeming foison, even so her plenteous wombexpresseth his full tilth and husbandry.isabella:some one with child by him? my cousin juliet?lucio:is she your cousin?isabella:adoptedly; as school-maids change their namesby vain though apt affection.lucio:she it is.isabella:o, let him marry her.lucio:this is the point.the duke is very strangely gone from hence;bore many gentlemen, myself being one,in hand and hope of action: but we do learnby those that know the very nerves of state,his givings-out were of an infinite distancefrom his true-meant design. upon his place,and with full line of his authority,governs lord angelo; a man whose bloodis very snow-broth; one who never feelsthe wanton stings and motions of the sense,but doth rebate and blunt his natural edgewith profits of the mind, study and fast.he--to give fear to use and liberty,which have for long run by the hideous law,as mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,under whose heavy sense your brother's lifefalls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;and follows close the rigour of the statute,to make him an example. all hope is gone,unless you have the grace by your fair prayerto soften angelo: and that's my pith of business'twixt you and your poor brother.isabella:doth he so seek his life?lucio:has censured himalready; and, as i hear, the provost hatha warrant for his execution.isabella:alas! what poor ability's in meto do him good?lucio:assay the power you have.isabella:my power? alas, i doubt--lucio:our doubts are traitorsand make us lose the good we oft might winby fearing to attempt. go to lord angelo,and let him learn to know, when maidens sue,men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,all their petitions are as freely theirsas they themselves would owe them.isabella:i'll see what i can do.lucio:but speedily.isabella:i will about it straight;no longer staying but to give the mothernotice of my affair. i humbly thank you:commend me to my brother: soon at nighti'll send him certain word of my success.lucio:i take my leave of you.isabella:good sir, adieu.angelo:we must not make a scarecrow of the law,setting it up to fear the birds of prey,and let it keep one shape, till custom make ittheir perch and not their terror.escalus:ay, but yetlet us be keen, and rather cut a little,than fall, and bruise to death. alas, this gentlemanwhom i would save, had a most noble father!let but your honour know,whom i believe to be most strait in virtue,that, in the working of your own affections,had time cohered with place or place with wishing,or that the resolute acting of your bloodcould have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,whether you had not sometime in your lifeerr'd in this point which now you censure him,and pull'd the law upon you.angelo:'tis one thing to be tempted, escalus,another thing to fall. i not deny,the jury, passing on the prisoner's life,may in the sworn twelve have a thief or twoguiltier than him they try. what's open made to justice,that justice seizes: what know the lawsthat thieves do pass on thieves? 'tis very pregnant,the jewel that we find, we stoop and take'tbecause we see it; but what we do not seewe tread upon, and never think of it.you may not so extenuate his offencefor i have had such faults; but rather tell me,when i, that censure him, do so offend,let mine own judgment pattern out my death,and nothing come in partial. sir, he must die.escalus:be it as your wisdom will.angelo:where is the provost?provost:here, if it like your honour.angelo:see that claudiobe executed by nine to-morrow morning:bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;for that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.escalus:elbow:come, bring them away: if these be good people ina commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses incommon houses, i know no law: bring them away.angelo:how now, sir! what's your name? and what's the matter?elbow:if it please your honour, i am the poor duke'sconstable, and my name is elbow: i do lean uponjustice, sir, and do bring in here before your goodhonour two notorious benefactors.angelo:benefactors? well; what benefactors are they? arethey not malefactors?elbow:if it? please your honour, i know not well what theyare: but precise villains they are, that i am sureof; and void of all profanation in the world thatgood christians ought to have.escalus:this comes off well; here's a wise officer.angelo:go to: what quality are they of? elbow is yourname? why dost thou not speak, elbow?pompey:he cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.angelo:what are you, sir?elbow:he, sir!

o, that's sudden! spare him, spare him!he's not prepared for death. even for our kitchenswe kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heavenwith less respect than we do ministerto our gross selves? good, good my lord, bethink you;who is it that hath died for this offence?there's many have committed it.lucio:angelo:the law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:those many had not dared to do that evil,if the first that did the edict infringehad answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awaketakes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,either new, or by remissness new-conceived,and so in progress to be hatch'd and born,are now to have no successive degrees,but, ere they live, to end.isabella:yet show some pity.angelo:i show it most of all when i show justice;for then i pity those i do not know,which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;and do him right that, answering one foul wrong,lives not to act another. be satisfied;your brother dies to-morrow; be content.isabella:so you must be the first that gives this sentence,and he, that suffer's. o, it is excellentto have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannousto use it like a giant.lucio:isabella:could great men thunderas jove himself does, jove would ne'er be quiet,for every pelting, petty officerwould use his heaven for thunder;nothing but thunder! merciful heaven,thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous boltsplit'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oakthan the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,drest in a little brief authority,most ignorant of what he's most assured,his glassy essence, like an angry ape,plays such fantastic tricks before high heavenas make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,would all themselves laugh mortal.lucio:provost:isabella:we cannot weigh our brother with ourself:great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,but in the less foul profanation.lucio:thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.isabella:that in the captain's but a choleric word,which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.lucio:angelo:why do you put these sayings upon me?isabella:because authority, though it err like others,hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,that skins the vice o' the top. go to your bosom;knock there, and ask your heart what it doth knowthat's like my brother's fault: if it confessa natural guiltiness such as is his,let it not sound a thought upon your tongueagainst my brother's life.angelo:isabella:gentle my lord, turn back.angelo:i will bethink me: come again tomorrow.isabella:hark how i'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.angelo:how! bribe me?isabella:ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.lucio:isabella:not with fond shekels of the tested gold,or stones whose rates are either rich or pooras fancy values them; but with true prayersthat shall be up at heaven and enter thereere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,from fasting maids whose minds are dedicateto nothing temporal.angelo:well; come to me to-morrow.lucio:isabella:heaven keep your honour safe!angelo:isabella:at what hour to-morrowshall i attend your lordship?angelo:at any time 'fore noon.isabella:'save your honour!angelo:from thee, even from thy virtue!what's this, what's this? is this her fault or mine?the tempter or the tempted, who sins most?ha!not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is ithat, lying by the violet in the sun,do as the carrion does, not as the flower,corrupt with virtuous season. can it bethat modesty may more betray our sensethan woman's lightness? having waste ground enough,shall we desire to raze the sanctuaryand pitch our evils there? o, fie, fie, fie!what dost thou, or what art thou, angelo?dost thou desire her foully for those thingsthat make her good? o, let her brother live!thieves for their robbery have authoritywhen judges steal themselves. what, do i love her,that i desire to hear her speak again,and feast upon her eyes? what is't i dream on?o cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,with saints dost bait thy hook! most dangerousis that temptation that doth goad us onto sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,with all her double vigour, art and nature,once stir my temper; but this virtuous maidsubdues me quite. even till now,when men were fond, i smiled and wonder'd how.duke vincentio:hail to you, provost! so i think you are.provost:i am the provost. what's your will, good friar?duke vincentio:bound by my charity and my blest order,i come to visit the afflicted spiritshere in the prison. do me the common rightto let me see them and to make me knowthe nature of their crimes, that i may ministerto them accordingly.provost:i would do more than that, if more were needful.look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,hath blister'd her report: she is with child;and he that got it, sentenced; a young manmore fit to do another such offencethan die for this.duke vincentio:when must he die?provost:as i do think, to-morrow.i have provided for you: stay awhile,and you shall be conducted.duke vincentio:repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?juliet:i do; and bear the shame most patiently.duke vincentio:i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,and try your penitence, if it be sound,or hollowly put on.juliet:i'll gladly learn.duke vincentio:love you the man that wrong'd you?juliet:yes, as i love the woman that wrong'd him.duke vincentio:so then it seems your most offenceful actwas mutually committed?juliet:mutually.duke vincentio:then was your sin of heavier kind than his.juliet:i do confess it, and repent it, father.duke vincentio:'tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,as that the sin hath brought you to this shame,which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,but as we stand in fear,--juliet:i do repent me, as it is an evil,and take the shame with joy.duke vincentio:there rest.your partner, as i hear, must die to-morrow,and i am going with instruction to him.grace go with you, benedicite!juliet:must die to-morrow! o injurious love,that respites me a life, whose very comfortis still a dying horror!provost:'tis pity of him.angelo:when i would pray and think, i think and prayto several subjects. heaven hath my empty words;whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,anchors on isabel: heaven in my mouth,as if i did but only chew his name;and in my heart the strong and swelling evilof my conception. the state, whereon i studiedis like a good thing, being often read,grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,wherein--let no man hear me--i take pride,could i with boot change for an idle plume,which the air beats for vain. o place, o form,how often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser soulsto thy false seeming! blood, thou art blood:let's write good angel on the devil's horn:'tis not the devil's crest.how now! who's there?servant:one isabel, a sister, desires access to you.angelo:teach her the way.o heavens!why does my blood thus muster to my heart,making both it unable for itself,and dispossessing all my other partsof necessary fitness?so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;come all to help him, and so stop the airby which he should revive: and even sothe general, subject to a well-wish'd king,quit their own part, and in obsequious fondnesscrowd to his presence, where their untaught lovemust needs appear offence.how now, fair maid?isabella:i am come to know your pleasure.angelo:that you might know it, would much better please methan to demand what 'tis. your brother cannot live.isabella:even so. heaven keep your honour!angelo:yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,as long as you or i yet he must die.isabella:under your sentence?angelo:yea.isabella:when, i beseech you? that in his reprieve,longer or shorter, he may be so fittedthat his soul sicken not.angelo:ha! fie, these filthy vices! it were as goodto pardon him that hath from nature stolena man already made, as to remittheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's imagein stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easyfalsely to take away a life true madeas to put metal in restrained meansto make a false one.isabella:'tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.angelo:say you so? then i shall pose you quickly.which had you rather, that the most just lawnow took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,give up your body to such sweet uncleannessas she that he hath stain'd?isabella:sir, believe this,i had rather give my body than my soul.angelo:i talk not of your soul: our compell'd sinsstand more for number than for accompt.isabella:how say you?angelo:nay, i'll not warrant that; for i can speakagainst the thing i say. answer to this:i, now the voice of the recorded law,pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:might there not be a charity in sinto save this brother's life?isabella:please you to do't,i'll take it as a peril to my soul,it is no sin at all, but charity.angelo:pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,were equal poise of sin and charity.isabella:that i do beg his life, if it be sin,heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,if that be sin, i'll make it my morn prayerto have it added to the faults of mine,and nothing of your answer.angelo:nay, but hear me.your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,or seem so craftily; and that's not good.isabella:let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,but graciously to know i am no better.angelo:thus wisdom wishes to appear most brightwhen it doth tax itself; as these black masksproclaim an enshield beauty ten times louderthan beauty could, display'd. but mark me;to be received plain, i'll speak more gross:your brother is to die.isabella:so.angelo:and his offence is so, as it appears,accountant to the law upon that pain.isabella:true.angelo:admit no other way to save his life,--as i subscribe not that, nor any other,but in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,finding yourself desired of such a person,whose credit with the judge, or own great place,could fetch your brother from the manaclesof the all-building law; and that there wereno earthly mean to save him, but that eitheryou must lay down the treasures of your bodyto this supposed, or else to let him suffer;what would you do?isabella:as much for my poor brother as myself:that is, were i under the terms of death,the impression of keen whips i'ld wear as rubies,and strip myself to death, as to a bedthat longing have been sick for, ere i'ld yieldmy body up to shame.angelo:then must your brother die.isabella:and 'twere the cheaper way:better it were a brother died at once,than that a sister, by redeeming him,should die for ever.angelo:were not you then as cruel as the sentencethat you have slander'd so?isabella:ignomy in ransom and free pardonare of two houses: lawful mercyis nothing kin to foul redemption.angelo:you seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;and rather proved the sliding of your brothera merriment than a vice.isabella:o, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,to have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:i something do excuse the thing i hate,for his advantage that i dearly love.angelo:we are all frail.isabella:else let my brother die,if not a feodary, but only heowe and succeed thy weakness.angelo:nay, women are frail too.isabella:ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;which are as easy broke as they make forms.women! help heaven! men their creation marin profiting by them. nay, call us ten times frail;for we are soft as our complexions are,and credulous to false prints.angelo:i think it well:and from this testimony of your own sex,--since i suppose we are made to be no strongerthan faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;i do arrest your words. be that you are,that is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;if you be one, as you are well express'dby all external warrants, show it now,by putting on the destined livery.isabella:i have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,let me entreat you speak the former language.angelo:plainly conceive, i love you.isabella:my brother did love juliet,and you tell me that he shall die for it.angelo:he shall not, isabel, if you give me love.isabella:i know your virtue hath a licence in't,which seems a little fouler than it is,to pluck on others.angelo:believe me, on mine honour,my words express my purpose.isabella:ha! little honour to be much believed,and most pernicious purpose! seeming, seeming!i will proclaim thee, angelo; look for't:sign me a present pardon for my brother,or with an outstretch'd throat i'll tell the world aloudwhat man thou art.angelo:who will believe thee, isabel?my unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,my vouch against you, and my place i' the state,will so your accusation overweigh,that you shall stifle in your own reportand smell of calumny. i have begun,and now i give my sensual race the rein:fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,that banish what they sue for; redeem thy brotherby yielding up thy body to my will;or else he must not only die the death,but thy unkindness shall his death draw outto lingering sufferance. answer me to-morrow,or, by the affection that now guides me most,i'll prove a tyrant to him. as for you,say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.isabella:to whom should i complain? did i tell this,who would believe me? o perilous mouths,that bear in them one and the self-same tongue,either of condemnation or approof;bidding the law make court'sy to their will:hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,to follow as it draws! i'll to my brother:though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.that, had he twenty heads to tender downon twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,before his sister should her body stoopto such abhorr'd pollution.then, isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:more than our brother is our chastity.i'll tell him yet of angelo's request,and fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.duke vincentio:so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo?claudio:the miserable have no other medicinebut only hope:i've hope to live, and am prepared to die.duke vincentio:be absolute for death; either death or lifeshall thereby be the sweeter. reason thus with life:if i do lose thee, i do lose a thingthat none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,servile to all the skyey influences,that dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;for him thou labour'st by thy flight to shunand yet runn'st toward him still. thou art not noble;for all the accommodations that thou bear'stare nursed by baseness. thou'rt by no means valiant;for thou dost fear the soft and tender forkof a poor worm. thy best of rest is sleep,and that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'stthy death, which is no more. thou art not thyself;for thou exist'st on many a thousand grainsthat issue out of dust. happy thou art not;for what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,and what thou hast, forget'st. thou art not certain;for thy complexion shifts to strange effects,after the moon. if thou art rich, thou'rt poor;for, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,and death unloads thee. friend hast thou none;for thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,the mere effusion of thy proper loins,do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,for ending thee no sooner. thou hast nor youth nor age,but, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youthbecomes as aged, and doth beg the almsof palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,to make thy riches pleasant. what's yet in thisthat bears the name of life? yet in this lifelie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,that makes these odds all even.claudio:i humbly thank you.to sue to live, i find i seek to die;and, seeking death, find life: let it come on.isabella:provost:who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.duke vincentio:dear sir, ere long i'll visit you again.claudio:most holy sir, i thank you.isabella:my business is a word or two with claudio.provost:and very welcome. look, signior, here's your sister.duke vincentio:provost, a word with you.provost:as many as you please.duke vincentio:bring me to hear them speak, where i may be concealed.claudio:now, sister, what's the comfort?isabella:why,as all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.lord angelo, having affairs to heaven,intends you for his swift ambassador,where you shall be an everlasting leiger:therefore your best appointment make with speed;to-morrow you set on.claudio:is there no remedy?isabella:none, but such remedy as, to save a head,to cleave a heart in twain.claudio:but is there any?isabella:yes, brother, you may live:there is a devilish mercy in the judge,if you'll implore it, that will free your life,but fetter you till death.claudio:perpetual durance?isabella:ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,though all the world's vastidity you had,to a determined scope.claudio:but in what nature?isabella:in such a one as, you consenting to't,would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,and leave you naked.claudio:let me know the point.isabella:o, i do fear thee, claudio; and i quake,lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,and six or seven winters more respectthan a perpetual honour. darest thou die?the sense of death is most in apprehension;and the poor beetle, that we tread upon,in corporal sufferance finds a pang as greatas when a giant dies.claudio:why give you me this shame?think you i can a resolution fetchfrom flowery tenderness? if i must die,i will encounter darkness as a bride,and hug it in mine arms.isabella:there spake my brother; there my father's gravedid utter forth a voice. yes, thou must die:thou art too noble to conserve a lifein base appliances. this outward-sainted deputy,whose settled visage and deliberate wordnips youth i' the head and follies doth emmewas falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devilhis filth within being cast, he would appeara pond as deep as hell.claudio:the prenzie angelo!isabella:o, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,the damned'st body to invest and coverin prenzie guards! dost thou think, claudio?if i would yield him my virginity,thou mightst be freed.claudio:o heavens! it cannot be.isabella:yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,so to offend him still. this night's the timethat i should do what i abhor to name,or else thou diest to-morrow.claudio:thou shalt not do't.isabella:o, were it but my life,i'ld throw it down for your deliveranceas frankly as a pin.claudio:thanks, dear isabel.isabella:be ready, claudio, for your death tomorrow.claudio:yes. has he affections in him,that thus can make him bite the law by the nose,when he would force it? sure, it is no sin,or of the deadly seven, it is the least.isabella:which is the least?claudio:if it were damnable, he being so wise,why would he for the momentary trickbe perdurably fined? o isabel!isabella:what says my brother?claudio:death is a fearful thing.isabella:and shamed life a hateful.claudio:ay, but to die, and go we know not where;to lie in cold obstruction and to rot;this sensible warm motion to becomea kneaded clod; and the delighted spiritto bathe in fiery floods, or to residein thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;to be imprison'd in the viewless winds,and blown with restless violence round aboutthe pendent world; or to be worse than worstof those that lawless and incertain thoughtimagine howling: 'tis too horrible!the weariest and most loathed worldly lifethat age, ache, penury and imprisonmentcan lay on nature is a paradiseto what we fear of death.isabella:alas, alas!claudio:sweet sister, let me live:what sin you do to save a brother's life,nature dispenses with the deed so farthat it becomes a virtue.isabella:o you beast!o faithless coward! o dishonest wretch!wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?is't not a kind of incest, to take lifefrom thine own sister's shame? what should i think?heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!for such a warped slip of wildernessne'er issued from his blood. take my defiance!die, perish! might but my bending downreprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,no word to save thee.claudio:nay, hear me, isabel.isabella:o, fie, fie, fie!thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:'tis best thou diest quickly.claudio:o hear me, isabella!duke vincentio:vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.isabella:what is your will?duke vincentio:might you dispense with your leisure, i would by andby have some speech with you: the satisfaction iwould require is likewise your own benefit.isabella:i have no superfluous leisure; my stay must bestolen out of other affairs; but i will attend you awhile.duke vincentio:son, i have overheard what hath passed between youand your sister. angelo had never the purpose tocorrupt her; only he hath made an essay of hervirtue to practise his judgment with the dispositionof natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,hath made him that gracious denial which he is mostglad to receive. i am confessor to angelo, and iknow this to be true; therefore prepare yourself todeath: do not satisfy your resolution with hopesthat are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go toyour knees and make ready.claudio:let me ask my sister pardon. i am so out of lovewith life that i will sue to be rid of it.duke vincentio:hold you there: farewell.provost, a word with you!provost:what's your will, fatherduke vincentio:that now you are come, you will be gone. leave meawhile with the maid: my mind promises with myhabit no loss shall touch her by my company.provost:in good time.duke vincentio:the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beautybrief in goodness; but grace, being the soul ofyour complexion, shall keep the body of it everfair. the assault that angelo hath made to you,fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, butthat frailty hath examples for his falling, i shouldwonder at angelo. how will you do to content thissubstitute, and to save your brother?isabella:i am now going to resolve him: i had rather mybrother die by the law than my son should beunlawfully born. but, o, how much is the good dukedeceived in angelo! if ever he return and i canspeak to him, i will open my lips in vain, ordiscover his government.duke vincentio:that shall not be much amiss: yet, as the matternow stands, he will avoid your accusation; he madetrial of you only. therefore fasten your ear on myadvisings: to the love i have in doing good aremedy presents itself. i do make myself believethat you may most uprighteously do a poor wrongedlady a merited benefit; redeem your brother fromthe angry law; do no stain to your own graciousperson; and much please the absent duke, ifperadventure he shall ever return to have hearing ofthis business.isabella:let me hear you speak farther. i have spirit to doanything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.duke vincentio:virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. haveyou not heard speak of mariana, the sister offrederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?isabella:i have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.duke vincentio:she should this angelo have married; was affiancedto her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: betweenwhich time of the contract and limit of thesolemnity, her brother frederick was wrecked at sea,having in that perished vessel the dowry of hissister. but mark how heavily this befell to thepoor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble andrenowned brother, in his love toward her ever mostkind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew ofher fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, hercombinate husband, this well-seeming angelo.isabella:can this be so? did angelo so leave her?duke vincentio:left her in her tears, and dried not one of themwith his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yetwears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,is washed with them, but relents not.isabella:what a merit were it in death to take this poor maidfrom the world! what corruption in this life, thatit will let this man live! but how out of this can she avail?duke vincentio:it is a rupture that you may easily heal: and thecure of it not only saves your brother, but keepsyou from dishonour in doing it.isabella:show me how, good father.duke vincentio:this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuanceof her first affection: his unjust unkindness, thatin all reason should have quenched her love, hath,like an impediment in the current, made it moreviolent and unruly. go you to angelo; answer hisrequiring with a plausible obedience; agree withhis demands to the point; only refer yourself tothis advantage, first, that your stay with him maynot be long; that the time may have all shadow andsilence in it; and the place answer to convenience.this being granted in course,--and now followsall,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead upyour appointment, go in your place; if the encounteracknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him toher recompense: and here, by this, is your brothersaved, your honour untainted, the poor marianaadvantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. the maidwill i frame and make fit for his attempt. if youthink well to carry this as you may, the doublenessof the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.what think you of it?isabella:the image of it gives me content already; and itrust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.duke vincentio:it lies much in your holding up. haste you speedilyto angelo: if for this night he entreat you to hisbed, give him promise of satisfaction. i willpresently to saint luke's: there, at the moatedgrange, resides this dejected mariana. at thatplace call upon me; and dispatch with angelo, thatit may be quickly.isabella:i thank you for this comfort. fare you well, good father.elbow:nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you willneeds buy and sell men and women like beasts, weshall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.duke vincentio:o heavens! what stuff is herepompey:'twas never merry world since, of two usuries, themerriest was put down, and the worser allowed byorder of law a furred gown to keep him warm; andfurred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, thatcraft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.elbow:come your way, sir. 'bless you, good father friar.duke vincentio:and you, good brother father. what offence haththis man made you, sir?elbow:marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, wetake him to be a thief too, sir; for we have foundupon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we havesent to the deputy.duke vincentio:fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!the evil that thou causest to be done,that is thy means to live. do thou but thinkwhat 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a backfrom such a filthy vice: say to thyself,from their abominable and beastly touchesi drink, i eat, array myself, and live.canst thou believe thy living is a life,so stinkingly depending? go mend, go mend.pompey:indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,sir, i would prove--duke vincentio:nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,thou wilt prove his. take him to prison, officer:correction and instruction must both workere this rude beast will profit.elbow:he must before the deputy, sir; he has given himwarning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: ifhe be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he wereas good go a mile on his errand.duke vincentio:that we were all, as some would seem to be,from our faults, as faults from seeming, free!elbow:his neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.pompey:i spy comfort; i cry bail. here's a gentleman and afriend of mine.lucio:how now, noble pompey! what, at the wheels ofcaesar? art thou led in triumph? what, is therenone of pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to behad now, for putting the hand in the pocket andextracting it clutch'd? what reply, ha? whatsayest thou to this tune, matter and method? is'tnot drowned i' the last rain, ha? what sayestthou, trot? is the world as it was, man? which isthe way? is it sad, and few words? or how? thetrick of it?duke vincentio:still thus, and thus; still worse!lucio:how doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? procures shestill, ha?pompey:troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and sheis herself in the tub.lucio:why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must beso: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:an unshunned consequence; it must be so. art goingto prison, pompey?pompey:yes, faith, sir.lucio:why, 'tis not amiss, pompey. farewell: go, say isent thee thither. for debt, pompey? or how?elbow:for being a bawd, for being a bawd.lucio:well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be thedue of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is hedoubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.farewell, good pompey. commend me to the prison,pompey: you will turn good husband now, pompey; youwill keep the house.pompey:i hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.lucio:no, indeed, will i not, pompey; it is not the wear.i will pray, pompey, to increase your bondage: ifyou take it not patiently, why, your mettle is themore. adieu, trusty pompey.

but wheresoever, i wish him well.lucio:it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal fromthe state, and usurp the beggary he was never bornto. lord angelo dukes it well in his absence; heputs transgression to 't.duke vincentio:he does well in 't.lucio:a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm inhim: something too crabbed that way, friar.duke vincentio:it is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.lucio:yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirpit quite, friar, till eating and drinking be putdown. they say this angelo was not made by man andwoman after this downright way of creation: is ittrue, think you?duke vincentio:how should he be made, then?lucio:some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that hewas begot between two stock-fishes. but it iscertain that when he makes water his urine iscongealed ice; that i know to be true: and he is amotion generative; that's infallible.duke vincentio:you are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.lucio:why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for therebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of aman! would the duke that is absent have done this?ere he would have hanged a man for the getting ahundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursinga thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: heknew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.duke vincentio:i never heard the absent duke much detected forwomen; he was not inclined that way.lucio:o, sir, you are deceived.duke vincentio:'tis not possible.lucio:who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; andhis use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: theduke had crotchets in him. he would be drunk too;that let me inform you.duke vincentio:you do him wrong, surely.lucio:sir, i was an inward of his. a shy fellow was theduke: and i believe i know the cause of hiswithdrawing.duke vincentio:what, i prithee, might be the cause?lucio:no, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within theteeth and the lips: but this i can let youunderstand, the greater file of the subject held theduke to be wise.duke vincentio:wise! why, no question but he was.lucio:a very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.duke vincentio:either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:the very stream of his life and the business he hathhelmed must upon a warranted need give him a betterproclamation. let him be but testimonied in his ownbringings-forth, and he shall appear to theenvious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.therefore you speak unskilfully: or if yourknowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.lucio:sir, i know him, and i love him.duke vincentio:love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge withdearer love.lucio:come, sir, i know what i know.duke vincentio:i can hardly believe that, since you know not whatyou speak. but, if ever the duke return, as ourprayers are he may, let me desire you to make youranswer before him. if it be honest you have spoke,you have courage to maintain it: i am bound to callupon you; and, i pray you, your name?lucio:sir, my name is lucio; well known to the duke.duke vincentio:he shall know you better, sir, if i may live toreport you.lucio:i fear you not.duke vincentio:o, you hope the duke will return no more; or youimagine me too unhurtful an opposite. but indeed ican do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.lucio:i'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,friar. but no more of this. canst thou tell ifclaudio die to-morrow or no?duke vincentio:why should he die, sir?lucio:why? for filling a bottle with a tundish. i wouldthe duke we talk of were returned again: theungenitured agent will unpeople the province withcontinency; sparrows must not build in hishouse-eaves, because they are lecherous. the dukeyet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he wouldnever bring them to light: would he were returned!marry, this claudio is condemned for untrussing.farewell, good friar: i prithee, pray for me. theduke, i say to thee again, would eat mutton onfridays. he's not past it yet, and i say to thee,he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brownbread and garlic: say that i said so. farewell.duke vincentio:no might nor greatness in mortalitycan censure 'scape; back-wounding calumnythe whitest virtue strikes. what king so strongcan tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?but who comes here?escalus:go; away with her to prison!mistress overdone:good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounteda merciful man; good my lord.escalus:double and treble admonition, and still forfeit inthe same kind! this would make mercy swear and playthe tyrant.provost:a bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it pleaseyour honour.mistress overdone:my lord, this is one lucio's information against me.mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in theduke's time; he promised her marriage: his childis a year and a quarter old, come philip and jacob:i have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!escalus:that fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him becalled before us. away with her to prison! go to;no more words.provost, my brother angelo will not be altered;claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnishedwith divines, and have all charitable preparation.if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not beso with him.provost:so please you, this friar hath been with him, andadvised him for the entertainment of death.escalus:good even, good father.duke vincentio:bliss and goodness on you!escalus:of whence are you?duke vincentio:not of this country, though my chance is nowto use it for my time: i am a brotherof gracious order, late come from the seein special business from his holiness.escalus:what news abroad i' the world?duke vincentio:none, but that there is so great a fever ongoodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerousto be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuousto be constant in any undertaking. there is scarcetruth enough alive to make societies secure; butsecurity enough to make fellowships accurst: muchupon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. thisnews is old enough, yet it is every day's news. ipray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?escalus:one that, above all other strifes, contendedespecially to know himself.duke vincentio:what pleasure was he given to?escalus:rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry atany thing which professed to make him rejoice: agentleman of all temperance. but leave we him tohis events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;and let me desire to know how you find claudioprepared. i am made to understand that you havelent him visitation.duke vincentio:he professes to have received no sinister measurefrom his judge, but most willingly humbles himselfto the determination of justice: yet had he framedto himself, by the instruction of his frailty, manydeceiving promises of life; which i by my goodleisure have discredited to him, and now is heresolved to die.escalus:you have paid the heavens your function, and theprisoner the very debt of your calling. i havelaboured for the poor gentleman to the extremestshore of my modesty: but my brother justice have ifound so severe, that he hath forced me to tell himhe is indeed justice.duke vincentio:if his own life answer the straitness of hisproceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if hechance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.escalus:i am going to visit the prisoner. fare you well.duke vincentio:peace be with you!he who the sword of heaven will bearshould be as holy as severe;pattern in himself to know,grace to stand, and virtue go;more nor less to others payingthan by self-offences weighing.shame to him whose cruel strikingkills for faults of his own liking!twice treble shame on angelo,to weed my vice and let his grow!o, what may man within him hide,though angel on the outward side!how may likeness made in crimes,making practise on the times,to draw with idle spiders' stringsmost ponderous and substantial things!craft against vice i must apply:with angelo to-night shall liehis old betrothed but despised;so disguise shall, by the disguised,pay with falsehood false exacting,and perform an old contracting.mariana:break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:here comes a man of comfort, whose advicehath often still'd my brawling discontent.i cry you mercy, sir; and well could wishyou had not found me here so musical:let me excuse me, and believe me so,my mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.duke vincentio:'tis good; though music oft hath such a charmto make bad good, and good provoke to harm.i pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquiredfor me here to-day? much upon this time havei promised here to meet.mariana:you have not been inquired after:i have sat here all day.duke vincentio:i do constantly believe you. the time is come evennow. i shall crave your forbearance a little: maybe i will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.mariana:i am always bound to you.duke vincentio:very well met, and well come.what is the news from this good deputy?isabella:he hath a garden circummured with brick,whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;and to that vineyard is a planched gate,that makes his opening with this bigger key:this other doth command a little doorwhich from the vineyard to the garden leads;there have i made my promiseupon the heavy middle of the nightto call upon him.duke vincentio:but shall you on your knowledge find this way?isabella:i have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:with whispering and most guilty diligence,in action all of precept, he did show methe way twice o'er.duke vincentio:are there no other tokensbetween you 'greed concerning her observance?isabella:no, none, but only a repair i' the dark;and that i have possess'd him my most staycan be but brief; for i have made him knowi have a servant comes with me along,that stays upon me, whose persuasion isi come about my brother.duke vincentio:'tis well borne up.i have not yet made known to marianaa word of this. what, ho! within! come forth!i pray you, be acquainted with this maid;she comes to do you good.isabella:i do desire the like.duke vincentio:do you persuade yourself that i respect you?mariana:good friar, i know you do, and have found it.duke vincentio:take, then, this your companion by the hand,who hath a story ready for your ear.i shall attend your leisure: but make haste;the vaporous night approaches.mariana:will't please you walk aside?duke vincentio:o place and greatness! millions of false eyesare stuck upon thee: volumes of reportrun with these false and most contrarious questsupon thy doings: thousand escapes of witmake thee the father of their idle dreamsand rack thee in their fancies.welcome, how agreed?isabella:she'll take the enterprise upon her, father,if you advise it.duke vincentio:it is not my consent,but my entreaty too.isabella:little have you to saywhen you depart from him, but, soft and low,'remember now my brother.'mariana:fear me not.duke vincentio:nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.he is your husband on a pre-contract:to bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,sith that the justice of your title to himdoth flourish the deceit. come, let us go:our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.provost:come hither, sirrah. can you cut off a man's head?pompey:if the man be a bachelor, sir, i can; but if he be amarried man, he's his wife's head, and i can nevercut off a woman's head.provost:come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me adirect answer. to-morrow morning are to die claudioand barnardine. here is in our prison a commonexecutioner, who in his office lacks a helper: ifyou will take it on you to assist him, it shallredeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall haveyour full time of imprisonment and your deliverancewith an unpitied whipping, for you have been anotorious bawd.pompey:sir, i have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;but yet i will be content to be a lawful hangman. iwould be glad to receive some instruction from myfellow partner.provost:what, ho! abhorson! where's abhorson, there?abhorson:do you call, sir?provost:sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow inyour execution. if you think it meet, compound withhim by the year, and let him abide here with you; ifnot, use him for the present and dismiss him. hecannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.abhorson:a bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.provost:go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turnthe scale.pompey:pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, agood favour you have, but that you have a hanginglook,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?abhorson:ay, sir; a mysterypompey:painting, sir, i have heard say, is a mystery; andyour whores, sir, being members of my occupation,using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:but what mystery there should be in hanging, if ishould be hanged, i cannot imagine.abhorson:sir, it is a mystery.pompey:proof?abhorson:every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it betoo little for your thief, your true man thinks itbig enough; if it be too big for your thief, yourthief thinks it little enough: so every true man'sapparel fits your thief.provost:are you agreed?pompey:sir, i will serve him; for i do find your hangman isa more penitent trade than your bawd; he dothoftener ask forgiveness.provost:you, sirrah, provide your block and your axeto-morrow four o'clock.abhorson:come on, bawd; i will instruct thee in my trade; follow.pompey:i do desire to learn, sir: and i hope, if you haveoccasion to use me for your own turn, you shall findme yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness i owe youa good turn.provost:call hither barnardine and claudio:the one has my pity; not a jot the other,being a murderer, though he were my brother.look, here's the warrant, claudio, for thy death:'tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrowthou must be made immortal. where's barnardine?claudio:as fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labourwhen it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:he will not wake.provost:who can do good on him?well, go, prepare yourself.but, hark, what noise?heaven give your spirits comfort!by and by.i hope it is some pardon or reprievefor the most gentle claudio.welcome father.duke vincentio:the best and wholesomest spirts of the nightenvelope you, good provost! who call'd here of late?provost:none, since the curfew rung.duke vincentio:not isabel?provost:no.duke vincentio:they will, then, ere't be long.provost:what comfort is for claudio?duke vincentio:there's some in hope.provost:it is a bitter deputy.duke vincentio:not so, not so; his life is parallel'deven with the stroke and line of his great justice:he doth with holy abstinence subduethat in himself which he spurs on his powerto qualify in others: were he meal'd with thatwhich he corrects, then were he tyrannous;but this being so, he's just.now are they come.this is a gentle provost: seldom whenthe steeled gaoler is the friend of men.how now! what noise? that spirit's possessed with hastethat wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.provost:there he must stay until the officerarise to let him in: he is call'd up.duke vincentio:have you no countermand for claudio yet,but he must die to-morrow?provost:none, sir, none.duke vincentio:as near the dawning, provost, as it is,you shall hear more ere morning.provost:happilyyou something know; yet i believe there comesno countermand; no such example have we:besides, upon the very siege of justicelord angelo hath to the public earprofess'd the contrary.this is his lordship's man.duke vincentio:and here comes claudio's pardon.messenger:provost:i shall obey him.duke vincentio:provost:i told you. lord angelo, belike thinking me remissin mine office, awakens me with this unwontedputting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.duke vincentio:pray you, let's hear.provost:duke vincentio:what is that barnardine who is to be executed in theafternoon?provost:a bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; onethat is a prisoner nine years old.duke vincentio:how came it that the absent duke had not eitherdelivered him to his liberty or executed him? ihave heard it was ever his manner to do so.provost:his friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,indeed, his fact, till now in the government of lordangelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.duke vincentio:it is now apparent?provost:most manifest, and not denied by himself.duke vincentio:hath he born himself penitently in prison? howseems he to be touched?provost:a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully butas a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearlessof what's past, present, or to come; insensible ofmortality, and desperately mortal.duke vincentio:he wants advice.provost:he will hear none: he hath evermore had the libertyof the prison; give him leave to escape hence, hewould not: drunk many times a day, if not many daysentirely drunk. we have very oft awaked him, as ifto carry him to execution, and showed him a seemingwarrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.duke vincentio:more of him anon. there is written in your brow,provost, honesty and constancy: if i read it nottruly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in theboldness of my cunning, i will lay myself in hazard.claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, isno greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hathsentenced him. to make you understand this in amanifested effect, i crave but four days' respite;for the which you are to do me both a present and adangerous courtesy.provost:pray, sir, in what?duke vincentio:in the delaying death.provost:a lack, how may i do it, having the hour limited,and an express command, under penalty, to deliverhis head in the view of angelo? i may make my caseas claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.duke vincentio:by the vow of mine order i warrant you, if myinstructions may be your guide. let this barnardinebe this morning executed, and his head born to angelo.provost:angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.duke vincentio:o, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it wasthe desire of the penitent to be so bared before hisdeath: you know the course is common. if any thingfall to you upon this, more than thanks and goodfortune, by the saint whom i profess, i will pleadagainst it with my life.provost:pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.duke vincentio:were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?provost:to him, and to his substitutes.duke vincentio:you will think you have made no offence, if the dukeavouch the justice of your dealing?provost:but what likelihood is in that?duke vincentio:not a resemblance, but a certainty. yet since i seeyou fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, norpersuasion can with ease attempt you, i will gofurther than i meant, to pluck all fears out of you.look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of theduke: you know the character, i doubt not; and thesignet is not strange to you.provost:i know them both.duke vincentio:the contents of this is the return of the duke: youshall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where youshall find, within these two days he will be here.this is a thing that angelo knows not; for he thisvery day receives letters of strange tenor;perchance of the duke's death; perchance enteringinto some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of whatis writ. look, the unfolding star calls up theshepherd. put not yourself into amazement how thesethings should be: all difficulties are but easywhen they are known. call your executioner, and offwith barnardine's head: i will give him a presentshrift and advise him for a better place. yet youare amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.come away; it is almost clear dawn.pompey:i am as well acquainted here as i was in our houseof profession: one would think it were mistressoverdone's own house, for here be many of her oldcustomers. first, here's young master rash; he's infor a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he madefive marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was notmuch in request, for the old women were all dead.then is there here one master caper, at the suit ofmaster three-pile the mercer, for some four suits ofpeach-coloured satin, which now peaches him abeggar. then have we here young dizy, and youngmaster deep-vow, and master copperspur, and masterstarve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and youngdrop-heir that killed lusty pudding, and masterforthlight the tilter, and brave master shooty thegreat traveller, and wild half-can that stabbedpots, and, i think, forty more; all great doers inour trade, and are now 'for the lord's sake.'abhorson:sirrah, bring barnardine hither.pompey:master barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.master barnardine!abhorson:what, ho, barnardine!barnardine:pompey:your friends, sir; the hangman. you must be sogood, sir, to rise and be put to death.barnardine:abhorson:tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.pompey:pray, master barnardine, awake till you areexecuted, and sleep afterwards.abhorson:go in to him, and fetch him out.pompey:he is coming, sir, he is coming; i hear his straw rustle.abhorson:is the axe upon the block, sirrah?pompey:very ready, sir.barnardine:how now, abhorson? what's the news with you?abhorson:truly, sir, i would desire you to clap into yourprayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.barnardine:you rogue, i have been drinking all night; i am notfitted for 't.pompey:o, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep thesounder all the next day.abhorson:look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: dowe jest now, think you?duke vincentio:sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastilyyou are to depart, i am come to advise you, comfortyou and pray with you.barnardine:friar, not i i have been drinking hard all night,and i will have more time to prepare me, or theyshall beat out my brains with billets: i will notconsent to die this day, that's certain.duke vincentio:o, sir, you must: and therefore i beseech youlook forward on the journey you shall go.barnardine:i swear i will not die to-day for any man'spersuasion.duke vincentio:but hear you.barnardine:not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,come to my ward; for thence will not i to-day.duke vincentio:unfit to live or die: o gravel heart!after him, fellows; bring him to the block.provost:now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?duke vincentio:a creature unprepared, unmeet for death;and to transport him in the mind he iswere damnable.provost:here in the prison, father,there died this morning of a cruel feverone ragozine, a most notorious pirate,a man of claudio's years; his beard and headjust of his colour. what if we do omitthis reprobate till he were well inclined;and satisfy the deputy with the visageof ragozine, more like to claudio?duke vincentio:o, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!dispatch it presently; the hour draws onprefix'd by angelo: see this be done,and sent according to command; whiles ipersuade this rude wretch willingly to die.provost:this shall be done, good father, presently.but barnardine must die this afternoon:and how shall we continue claudio,to save me from the danger that might comeif he were known alive?duke vincentio:let this be done.put them in secret holds, both barnardine and claudio:ere twice the sun hath made his journal greetingto the under generation, you shall findyour safety manifested.provost:i am your free dependant.duke vincentio:quick, dispatch, and send the head to angelo.now will i write letters to angelo,--the provost, he shall bear them, whose contentsshall witness to him i am near at home,and that, by great injunctions, i am boundto enter publicly: him i'll desireto meet me at the consecrated founta league below the city; and from thence,by cold gradation and well-balanced form,we shall proceed with angelo.provost:here is the head; i'll carry it myself.duke vincentio:convenient is it. make a swift return;for i would commune with you of such thingsthat want no ear but yours.provost:i'll make all speed.isabella:duke vincentio:the tongue of isabel. she's come to knowif yet her brother's pardon be come hither:but i will keep her ignorant of her good,to make her heavenly comforts of despair,when it is least expected.isabella:ho, by your leave!duke vincentio:good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.isabella:the better, given me by so holy a man.hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?duke vincentio:he hath released him, isabel, from the world:his head is off and sent to angelo.isabella:nay, but it is not so.duke vincentio:it is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,in your close patience.isabella:o, i will to him and pluck out his eyes!duke vincentio:you shall not be admitted to his sight.isabella:unhappy claudio! wretched isabel!injurious world! most damned angelo!duke vincentio:this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.mark what i say, which you shall findby every syllable a faithful verity:the duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;one of our convent, and his confessor,gives me this instance: already he hath carriednotice to escalus and angelo,who do prepare to meet him at the gates,there to give up their power. if you can, pace your wisdomin that good path that i would wish it go,and you shall have your bosom on this wretch,grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,and general honour.isabella:i am directed by you.duke vincentio:this letter, then, to friar peter give;'tis that he sent me of the duke's return:say, by this token, i desire his companyat mariana's house to-night. her cause and yoursi'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring youbefore the duke, and to the head of angeloaccuse him home and home. for my poor self,i am combined by a sacred vowand shall be absent. wend you with this letter:command these fretting waters from your eyeswith a light heart; trust not my holy order,if i pervert your course. who's here?lucio:good even. friar, where's the provost?duke vincentio:not within, sir.lucio:o pretty isabella, i am pale at mine heart to seethine eyes so red: thou must be patient. i am fainto dine and sup with water and bran; i dare not formy head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would setme to 't. but they say the duke will be hereto-morrow. by my troth, isabel, i loved thy brother:if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had beenat home, he had lived.duke vincentio:sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to yourreports; but the best is, he lives not in them.lucio:friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as i do:he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.duke vincentio:well, you'll answer this one day. fare ye well.lucio:nay, tarry; i'll go along with theei can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.duke vincentio:you have told me too many of him already, sir, ifthey be true; if not true, none were enough.lucio:i was once before him for getting a wench with child.duke vincentio:did you such a thing?lucio:yes, marry, did i but i was fain to forswear it;they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.duke vincentio:sir, your company is fairer than honest. rest you well.lucio:by my troth, i'll go with thee to the lane's end:if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little ofit. nay, friar, i am a kind of burr; i shall stick.escalus:every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.angelo:in most uneven and distracted manner. his actionsshow much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom benot tainted! and why meet him at the gates, andredeliver our authorities thereescalus:i guess not.angelo:and why should we proclaim it in an hour before hisentering, that if any crave redress of injustice,they should exhibit their petitions in the street?escalus:he shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch ofcomplaints, and to deliver us from deviceshereafter, which shall then have no power to standagainst us.angelo:well, i beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimesi' the morn; i'll call you at your house: givenotice to such men of sort and suit as are to meethim.escalus:i shall, sir. fare you well.angelo:good night.this deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnantand dull to all proceedings. a deflower'd maid!and by an eminent body that enforcedthe law against it! but that her tender shamewill not proclaim against her maiden loss,how might she tongue me! yet reason dares her no;for my authority bears of a credent bulk,that no particular scandal once can touchbut it confounds the breather. he should have lived,save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,by so receiving a dishonour'd lifewith ransom of such shame. would yet he had lived!a lack, when once our grace we have forgot,nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.duke vincentio:these letters at fit time deliver methe provost knows our purpose and our plot.the matter being afoot, keep your instruction,and hold you ever to our special drift;though sometimes you do blench from this to that,as cause doth minister. go call at flavius' house,and tell him where i stay: give the like noticeto valentinus, rowland, and to crassus,and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;but send me flavius first.friar peter:it shall be speeded well.duke vincentio:i thank thee, varrius; thou hast made good haste:come, we will walk. there's other of our friendswill greet us here anon, my gentle varrius.isabella:to speak so indirectly i am loath:i would say the truth; but to accuse him so,that is your part: yet i am advised to do it;he says, to veil full purpose.mariana:be ruled by him.isabella:besides, he tells me that, if peradventurehe speak against me on the adverse side,i should not think it strange; for 'tis a physicthat's bitter to sweet end.mariana:i would friar peter--isabella:o, peace! the friar is come.friar peter:come, i have found you out a stand most fit,where you may have such vantage on the duke,he shall not pass you. twice have the trumpets sounded;the generous and gravest citizenshave hent the gates, and very near uponthe duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!duke vincentio:my very worthy cousin, fairly met!our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.angelo:happy return be to your royal grace!duke vincentio:many and hearty thankings to you both.we have made inquiry of you; and we hearsuch goodness of your justice, that our soulcannot but yield you forth to public thanks,forerunning more requital.angelo:you make my bonds still greater.duke vincentio:o, your desert speaks loud; and i should wrong it,to lock it in the wards of covert bosom,when it deserves, with characters of brass,a forted residence 'gainst the tooth of timeand razure of oblivion. give me your hand,and let the subject see, to make them knowthat outward courtesies would fain proclaimfavours that keep within. come, escalus,you must walk by us on our other hand;and good supporters are you.friar peter:now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.isabella:justice, o royal duke! vail your regardupon a wrong'd, i would fain have said, a maid!o worthy prince, dishonour not your eyeby throwing it on any other objecttill you have heard me in my true complaintand given me justice, justice, justice, justice!duke vincentio:relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.here is lord angelo shall give you justice:reveal yourself to him.isabella:o worthy duke,you bid me seek redemption of the devil:hear me yourself; for that which i must speakmust either punish me, not being believed,or wring redress from you. hear me, o hear me, here!angelo:my lord, her wits, i fear me, are not firm:she hath been a suitor to me for her brothercut off by course of justice,--isabella:by course of justice!angelo:and she will speak most bitterly and strange.isabella:most strange, but yet most truly, will i speak:that angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?that angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?that angelo is an adulterous thief,an hypocrite, a virgin-violator;is it not strange and strange?duke vincentio:nay, it is ten times strange.isabella:it is not truer he is angelothan this is all as true as it is strange:nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truthto the end of reckoning.duke vincentio:away with her! poor soul,she speaks this in the infirmity of sense.isabella:o prince, i conjure thee, as thou believestthere is another comfort than this world,that thou neglect me not, with that opinionthat i am touch'd with madness! make not impossiblethat which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossiblebut one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,may seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absoluteas angelo; even so may angelo,in all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:if he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,had i more name for badness.duke vincentio:by mine honesty,if she be mad,--as i believe no other,--her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,such a dependency of thing on thing,as e'er i heard in madness.isabella:o gracious duke,harp not on that, nor do not banish reasonfor inequality; but let your reason serveto make the truth appear where it seems hid,and hide the false seems true.duke vincentio:many that are not madhave, sure, more lack of reason. what would you say?isabella:i am the sister of one claudio,condemn'd upon the act of fornicationto lose his head; condemn'd by angelo:i, in probation of a sisterhood,was sent to by my brother; one lucioas then the messenger,--lucio:that's i, an't like your grace:i came to her from claudio, and desired herto try her gracious fortune with lord angelofor her poor brother's pardon.isabella:that's he indeed.duke vincentio:you were not bid to speak.lucio:no, my good lord;nor wish'd to hold my peace.duke vincentio:i wish you now, then;pray you, take note of it: and when you havea business for yourself, pray heaven you thenbe perfect.lucio:i warrant your honour.duke vincentio:the warrants for yourself; take heed to't.isabella:this gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--lucio:right.duke vincentio:it may be right; but you are i' the wrongto speak before your time. proceed.isabella:i wentto this pernicious caitiff deputy,--duke vincentio:that's somewhat madly spoken.isabella:pardon it;the phrase is to the matter.duke vincentio:mended again. the matter; proceed.isabella:in brief, to set the needless process by,how i persuaded, how i pray'd, and kneel'd,how he refell'd me, and how i replied,--for this was of much length,--the vile conclusioni now begin with grief and shame to utter:he would not, but by gift of my chaste bodyto his concupiscible intemperate lust,release my brother; and, after much debatement,my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,and i did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,his purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrantfor my poor brother's head.duke vincentio:this is most likely!isabella:o, that it were as like as it is true!duke vincentio:by heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,or else thou art suborn'd against his honourin hateful practise. first, his integritystands without blemish. next, it imports no reasonthat with such vehemency he should pursuefaults proper to himself: if he had so offended,he would have weigh'd thy brother by himselfand not have cut him off. some one hath set you on:confess the truth, and say by whose advicethou camest here to complain.isabella:and is this all?then, o you blessed ministers above,keep me in patience, and with ripen'd timeunfold the evil which is here wrapt upin countenance! heaven shield your grace from woe,as i, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!duke vincentio:i know you'ld fain be gone. an officer!to prison with her! shall we thus permita blasting and a scandalous breath to fallon him so near us? this needs must be a practise.who knew of your intent and coming hither?isabella:one that i would were here, friar lodowick.duke vincentio:a ghostly father, belike. who knows that lodowick?lucio:my lord, i know him; 'tis a meddling friar;i do not like the man: had he been lay, my lordfor certain words he spake against your gracein your retirement, i had swinged him soundly.duke vincentio:words against me? this is a good friar, belike!and to set on this wretched woman hereagainst our substitute! let this friar be found.lucio:but yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,i saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,a very scurvy fellow.friar peter:blessed be your royal grace!i have stood by, my lord, and i have heardyour royal ear abused. first, hath this womanmost wrongfully accused your substitute,who is as free from touch or soil with heras she from one ungot.duke vincentio:we did believe no less.know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of?friar peter:i know him for a man divine and holy;not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,as he's reported by this gentleman;and, on my trust, a man that never yetdid, as he vouches, misreport your grace.lucio:my lord, most villanously; believe it.friar peter:well, he in time may come to clear himself;but at this instant he is sick my lord,of a strange fever. upon his mere request,being come to knowledge that there was complaintintended 'gainst lord angelo, came i hither,to speak, as from his mouth, what he doth knowis true and false; and what he with his oathand all probation will make up full clear,whensoever he's convented. first, for this woman.to justify this worthy nobleman,so vulgarly and personally accused,her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,till she herself confess it.duke vincentio:good friar, let's hear it.do you not smile at this, lord angelo?o heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!give us some seats. come, cousin angelo;in this i'll be impartial; be you judgeof your own cause. is this the witness, friar?first, let her show her face, and after speak.mariana:pardon, my lord; i will not show my faceuntil my husband bid me.duke vincentio:what, are you married?mariana:no, my lord.duke vincentio:are you a maid?mariana:no, my lord.duke vincentio:a widow, then?mariana:neither, my lord.duke vincentio:why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?lucio:my lord, she may be a punk; for many of them areneither maid, widow, nor wife.duke vincentio:silence that fellow: i would he had some causeto prattle for himself.lucio:well, my lord.mariana:my lord; i do confess i ne'er was married;and i confess besides i am no maid:i have known my husband; yet my husbandknows not that ever he knew me.lucio:he was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.duke vincentio:for the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!lucio:well, my lord.duke vincentio:this is no witness for lord angelo.mariana:now i come to't my lordshe that accuses him of fornication,in self-same manner doth accuse my husband,and charges him my lord, with such a timewhen i'll depose i had him in mine armswith all the effect of love.angelo:charges she more than me?mariana:not that i know.duke vincentio:no? you say your husband.mariana:why, just, my lord, and that is angelo,who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,but knows he thinks that he knows isabel's.angelo:this is a strange abuse. let's see thy face.mariana:my husband bids me; now i will unmask.this is that face, thou cruel angelo,which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;this is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,was fast belock'd in thine; this is the bodythat took away the match from isabel,and did supply thee at thy garden-housein her imagined person.duke vincentio:know you this woman?lucio:carnally, she says.duke vincentio:sirrah, no more!lucio:enough, my lord.angelo:my lord, i must confess i know this woman:and five years since there was some speech of marriagebetwixt myself and her; which was broke off,partly for that her promised proportionscame short of composition, but in chieffor that her reputation was disvaluedin levity: since which time of five yearsi never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,upon my faith and honour.mariana:noble prince,as there comes light from heaven and words from breath,as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,i am affianced this man's wife as stronglyas words could make up vows: and, my good lord,but tuesday night last gone in's garden-househe knew me as a wife. as this is true,let me in safety raise me from my kneesor else for ever be confixed here,a marble monument!angelo:i did but smile till now:now, good my lord, give me the scope of justicemy patience here is touch'd. i do perceivethese poor informal women are no morebut instruments of some more mightier memberthat sets them on: let me have way, my lord,to find this practise out.duke vincentio:ay, with my heartand punish them to your height of pleasure.thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,though they would swear down each particular saint,were testimonies against his worth and creditthat's seal'd in approbation? you, lord escalus,sit with my cousin; lend him your kind painsto find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.there is another friar that set them on;let him be sent for.friar peter:would he were here, my lord! for he indeedhath set the women on to this complaint:your provost knows the place where he abidesand he may fetch him.duke vincentio:go do it instantly.and you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,do with your injuries as seems you best,in any chastisement: i for a while will leave you;but stir not you till you have well determinedupon these slanderers.escalus:my lord, we'll do it throughly.signior lucio, did not you say you knew thatfriar lodowick to be a dishonest person?lucio:'cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothingbut in his clothes; and one that hath spoke mostvillanous speeches of the duke.escalus:we shall entreat you to abide here till he come andenforce them against him: we shall find this friar anotable fellow.lucio:as any in vienna, on my word.escalus:call that same isabel here once again; i would speak with her.pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; youshall see how i'll handle her.lucio:not better than he, by her own report.escalus:say you?lucio:marry, sir, i think, if you handled her privately,she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,she'll be ashamed.escalus:i will go darkly to work with her.lucio:that's the way; for women are light at midnight.escalus:come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies allthat you have said.lucio:my lord, here comes the rascal i spoke of; here withthe provost.escalus:in very good time: speak not you to him till wecall upon you.lucio:mum.escalus:come, sir: did you set these women on to slanderlord angelo? they have confessed you did.duke vincentio:'tis false.escalus:how! know you where you are?duke vincentio:respect to your great place! and let the devilbe sometime honour'd for his burning throne!where is the duke?

is the duke gone?then is your cause gone too. the duke's unjust,thus to retort your manifest appeal,and put your trial in the villain's mouthwhich here you come to accuse.lucio:this is the rascal; this is he i spoke of.escalus:why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these womento accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouthand in the witness of his proper ear,to call him villain? and then to glance from himto the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?take him hence; to the rack with him! we'll touse youjoint by joint, but we will know his purpose.what 'unjust'!duke vincentio:be not so hot; the dukedare no more stretch this finger of mine than hedare rack his own: his subject am i not,nor here provincial. my business in this statemade me a looker on here in vienna,where i have seen corruption boil and bubbletill it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,but faults so countenanced, that the strong statutesstand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,as much in mock as mark.escalus:slander to the state! away with him to prison!angelo:what can you vouch against him, signior lucio?is this the man that you did tell us of?lucio:'tis he, my lord. come hither, goodman baldpate:do you know me?duke vincentio:i remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: imet you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.lucio:o, did you so? and do you remember what you said of the duke?duke vincentio:most notedly, sir.lucio:do you so, sir? and was the duke a fleshmonger, afool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?duke vincentio:you must, sir, change persons with me, ere you makethat my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; andmuch more, much worse.lucio:o thou damnable fellow! did not i pluck thee by thenose for thy speeches?duke vincentio:i protest i love the duke as i love myself.angelo:hark, how the villain would close now, after histreasonable abuses!escalus:such a fellow is not to be talked withal. away withhim to prison! where is the provost? away with himto prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let himspeak no more. away with those giglots too, andwith the other confederate companion!duke vincentio:angelo:what, resists he? help him, lucio.lucio:come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! why, youbald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, mustyou? show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!will't not off?duke vincentio:thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.first, provost, let me bail these gentle three.sneak not away, sir; for the friar and youmust have a word anon. lay hold on him.lucio:this may prove worse than hanging.duke vincentio:angelo:o my dread lord,i should be guiltier than my guiltiness,to think i can be undiscernible,when i perceive your grace, like power divine,hath look'd upon my passes. then, good prince,no longer session hold upon my shame,but let my trial be mine own confession:immediate sentence then and sequent deathis all the grace i beg.duke vincentio:come hither, mariana.say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?angelo:i was, my lord.duke vincentio:go take her hence, and marry her instantly.do you the office, friar; which consummate,return him here again. go with him, provost.escalus:my lord, i am more amazed at his dishonourthan at the strangeness of it.duke vincentio:come hither, isabel.your friar is now your prince: as i was thenadvertising and holy to your business,not changing heart with habit, i am stillattorney'd at your service.isabella:o, give me pardon,that i, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'dyour unknown sovereignty!duke vincentio:you are pardon'd, isabel:and now, dear maid, be you as free to us.your brother's death, i know, sits at your heart;and you may marvel why i obscured myself,labouring to save his life, and would not rathermake rash remonstrance of my hidden powerthan let him so be lost. o most kind maid,it was the swift celerity of his death,which i did think with slower foot came on,that brain'd my purpose. but, peace be with him!that life is better life, past fearing death,than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,so happy is your brother.isabella:i do, my lord.duke vincentio:for this new-married man approaching here,whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'dyour well defended honour, you must pardonfor mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--being criminal, in double violationof sacred chastity and of promise-breachthereon dependent, for your brother's life,--the very mercy of the law cries outmost audible, even from his proper tongue,'an angelo for claudio, death for death!'haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;like doth quit like, and measure still for measure.then, angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.we do condemn thee to the very blockwhere claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.away with him!mariana:o my most gracious lord,i hope you will not mock me with a husband.duke vincentio:it is your husband mock'd you with a husband.consenting to the safeguard of your honour,i thought your marriage fit; else imputation,for that he knew you, might reproach your lifeand choke your good to come; for his possessions,although by confiscation they are ours,we do instate and widow you withal,to buy you a better husband.mariana:o my dear lord,i crave no other, nor no better man.duke vincentio:never crave him; we are definitive.mariana:gentle my liege,--duke vincentio:you do but lose your labour.away with him to death!now, sir, to you.mariana:o my good lord!

if you be gentlemen,do me this right; hear me with patience.baptista is a noble gentleman,to whom my father is not all unknown;and were his daughter fairer than she is,she may more suitors have and me for one.fair leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;then well one more may fair bianca have:and so she shall; lucentio shall make one,though paris came in hope to speed alone.gremio:what!
